          <b>Understanding the Solar Mission:</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          ISRO's Solar Mission, named after the Sanskrit word "Aditya," meaning
          Sun, is a pioneering project aimed at comprehensively studying our
          closest star, the Sun. The Aditya-L1 spacecraft will be strategically
          positioned in orbit around the L1 Lagrange point, approximately 1.5
          million kilometers away from Earth. Why Study the Sun? The Sun is not
          just a celestial object that provides us with light and warmth; it is
          a dynamic and complex star with a profound impact on our solar system
          and our planet. Understanding the Sun is essential for several
          reasons:
          <br />
          <br />
          <ol>
            <li>
              Space Weather Prediction: Solar activity can influence space
              weather, leading to disruptions in communication systems, GPS
              navigation, and even power grids. By monitoring and predicting
              solar activity, we can better prepare for and mitigate potential
              disruptions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Climate Studies: The Sun's energy output varies over time,
              contributing to climate fluctuations on Earth. By studying the
              Sun, scientists can gain insights into long-term climate patterns
              and improve climate change models.
            </li>
            <li>
              Solar Energy Optimization's: Solar power is a key component of
              clean and sustainable energy solutions. Understanding the Sun's
              behaviors allows us to design more efficient solar power
              generation systems.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Key Objectives of the Solar Mission:</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          <ol>
            <li>
              Solar Corona Study: Aditya-L1 will focus on the study of the solar
              corona, the outermost layer of the Sun's atmosphere. This region
              is of particular interest because it plays a critical role in
              solar eruptions and the solar wind, which can impact Earth.
            </li>
            <li>
              Magnetic Field Observations: The mission aims to provide detailed
              information about the Sun's magnetic field, shedding light on its
              influence on solar activity.
            </li>
            <li>
              X-ray and UV Imaging: Aditya-L1 will capture high-resolution
              images of the Sun in X-ray and ultraviolet wavelengths, allowing
              scientists to study solar flares, prominences, and other dynamic
              solar phenomena.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Conclusion:</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          ISRO's Solar Mission is a testament to India's commitment to space
          exploration and scientific discovery. By advancing our understanding
          of the Sun, this mission holds the promise of improving space weather
          prediction, climate studies, and the efficiency of clean energy
          solutions. The knowledge gained from Aditya-L1 will not only
          contribute to scientific advancement but also have practical
          applications that benefit society as a whole. As we look to the skies,
          ISRO's Solar Mission reminds us of the importance of exploring and
          understanding the celestial bodies that shape our world.

          <b>BEGINNING OF INNOVATION</b> <br />
          <br />
          Respiration is one of the most important processes for the survival of
          human beings. If this process fails it leads to a major issue called
          respiratory failure which makes it difficult to get enough oxygen into
          the blood. Interestingly, we humans are experts in bringing new
          technologies to compensate for the problems that we face. Ventilators
          are such great inventions that made our lives better. These are
          mechanical devices that act like a device called bellows that help air
          to move in and out of the lungs when breathing becomes a difficult
          process. The patient is provided with a mask to provide air from the
          ventilator or even a tube if a health condition is serious. The truth
          is innovations never stop this fact led to the invention of different
          types of ventilators like negative-pressure ventilators,
          positive-pressure invasive ventilators, positive-pressure noninvasive
          ventilators, and so on.

          <br /> <br />
          <b>NEGATIVE-PRESSURE VENTILATORS</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          These ventilators came into effect throughout the first half of the
          20th century which was a full body ventilator. The patient's body was
          maintained in a sitting position except for the head in an air-tight
          box. The negative pressure was established by pumping air into and out
          of the box. Later large chambers were used in place of a box where the
          surgeon was able to perform surgery while also in the chamber. These
          ventilators had their- own disadvantages these devices were large,
          heavy, and cumbersome and it was difficult to avoid excessive leaking,
          it was also difficult to maintain effective ventilation and sustain
          high airway pressure which reduced their availability gradually.
          <br /> <br />
          <br />
          <b>POSITIVE-PRESSURE NONINVASIVE VENTILATORS</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          Positive-pressure noninvasive ventilators (NIV)were first reported in
          the mid-eighteenth century. It involves the delivery of oxygen into
          the lungs via positive pressure without need for endotracheal
          intubation. It is used not only for acute respiratory diseases but
          also for chronic ones. The most common problem with these ventilators
          was the mask discomfort another adverse effect also includes skin rash
          and nasal bridge ulcers. Aerophagia and sialorrhea were also caused.
          <br />
          <br /> <br />
          <b>POSITIVE-PRESSURE INVASIVE VENTILATORS</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          These ventilators came into effect in the 1940s and 1950s where
          positive pressure is delivered into the lungs with the support of an
          endotracheal tube or tracheostomy tube. The mortality of invasive
          ventilation is 20%. The aim of this type of ventilation is to support
          gas exchange and respiratory muscle function whereas other treatments
          would take much longer time and this results in the advantage where
          antibiotics could be given from the inhaler to the ventilator.
          <br />
          <br /> <br />
          <b>INNOVATION CONTINUES: SOFT IMPLANTABLE VENTILATOR</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          Engineers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), USA,
          successfully studied and developed a soft, robotic, and implantable
          ventilator that is designed to supplement the diaphragm’s natural
          contractions. The group of engineers was led by Ellen Roche, associate
          professor of mechanical engineering. They aim to boost the diaphragm’s
          life-sustaining function and improve lung capacity for people with
          diaphragm dysfunction. The team of engineers began brainstorming
          designs for an implantable ventilator well before the COVID-19
          pandemic when the use of conventional ventilators intensified along
          with cases.
          <br />
          <br /> <br />
          <b>BASIC PRINCIPLE</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          Conventional ventilators create a positive pressure where the air is
          pushed by the patient into the middle of the airway and forced into
          the lungs. On the other hand, the diaphragm creates negative pressure.
          When muscles contract and push, it creates a negative pressure that
          pulls air into the lungs. This sparked Roche and her team's interest
          in developing a soft implantable ventilator.

            style={{ width: "100%" }}
          />
          <br /> <br />
          <b>DESIGN AND WORKING</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          At the heart of the system are two soft, balloon-like tubes sewn onto
          the diaphragm. When inflated with an external pump, the tubes (which
          can be inflated at a frequency to match the diaphragm’s natural
          rhythm) act as artificial muscles to push down on the diaphragm and
          help the lungs expand. The ‘inflatable tubes’ are designed after a
          type of pneumatic device known as McKibben actuators (which are widely
          regarded as promising actuators for robotics and automation). The team
          adapted the tubes such that they lie across the diaphragm (from front
          to back) and attach to the ribcage at either side of the dome shaped
          muscle. One end of each tube is connected to a long, thin outdoor
          airline that connects to a small pump and control system. By analyzing
          the diaphragm’s contractions, the team can then program the pump to
          inflate the tubes at a similar 3/3 frequency. Interestingly, Roche
          mentions that it isn’t necessary to fully mock the diaphragm’s
          movement and that it is enough to give it an extra push downward when
          it naturally contracts.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>RESEARCH TRIALS</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          The researchers tested this on anesthetized pigs, implanting the tubes
          over the animals’ diaphragm and surgically attaching the ends of the
          tubes to ribs on either end of the muscle. The animal’s oxygen levels
          were carefully monitored, and the diaphragm function was observed
          using ultrasound imaging. It was observed that in general, the
          implantable ventilator increased the amount of air that the pig’s
          lungs could draw in with every breath. The most significant
          improvement was seen in cases where the contractions of the diaphragm
          and the artificial muscles were in sync. It was found that this
          ventilator helped the diaphragm draw in 3 times the amount of air than
          it normally would. Their vision is to miniaturize certain parts of
          this system further and make the whole apparatus more compact. The
          pump and control system could be worn on a belt or backpack, or even
          better, fully implantable.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>CONCLUSION</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          Innovations in the field of mechanical engineering are a never-ending
          phenomenon and it only flourishes day by day. The discovery of a soft
          implantable ventilator is just the beginning in this field which makes
          our lives better in the future era. These recent developments
          revolutionize many industries and open up a window of opportunities,
          for those who want it. Improvement in technological advancement helps
          mechanical engineering play a vital role in molding the future and
          building a civilization that is technologically advanced and
          sustainable.

    title: "Mind-controlled Prosthetics of the future",
    description: (
      <div class="container" style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
        <p>
          The world of prosthetics is developing quicker by the year. Doctors,
          engineers, and students are all striving to design more effective
          artificial limbs that can help amputees and sufferers of paralysis
          live not only more comfortable but also thrive. A prosthesis is an
          artificial device that replaces a missing part of the body, which may
          be lost as a result of trauma, illness, or a condition that occurs at
          birth. Prosthetics can be created by hand or with computer-aided
          design, a software interface that helps designers design and analyze
          creation. When God gifted us a pair of hands and legs, we never
          thought about the world without them, but to those people who don’t
          have limbs, it is difficult to do their daily life activities. For
          example, it’s difficult for amputees to open a bottle. So, for them,
          prosthetics is a gamechanger in their life.
          <br />
          <br />
          Prosthetics were developed in the nineties, but they were heavy, huge,
          and very expensive. The problem with prosthetics is a longstanding one
          that researchers have been working on for many years. They are
          attempting to create a prosthetic that acts as if it is the original
          limb or body part. So, mind-controlled prosthetics came into
          existence, which is a very interesting concept. Prosthetics is
          transmitted through the stump of the arm and is thought-controlled via
          electrical muscle and neural signals recorded by the electrodes. The
          signal is sent to the implant, which passes through the skin and
          connects to the prosthesis.
          <br />
          <br />
          This achievement is unique. Patients have been using mind-guided
          prostheses in their daily life for up to 7 years. For the past few
          years, they have also lived with new touch-sensing capabilities in
          their prosthetics. This is a new concept prosthetic leg called a
          neuromusculoskeletal prosthesis because it is connected to the user's
          nerves, muscles, and skeleton. It is directly related to nerves,
          muscles, and supervision.
          <br />
          <br />
          The latest technology is touch sensation, which is made possible by
          stimulating nerves previously associated with biological arms before
          amputation. A force sensor on the thumb of the prosthesis measures
          contacts and pressure applied to an object while gripping. This
          information travels along the patient's nerves to the brain.
          Therefore, when the patient touches an object, he can feel the nature
          of the object and the degree of pressing, which is very important for
          simulating a biological hand.
          <br />
          <br />
          How is mind-controlled prosthetics different from Conventional
          prosthetics? In traditional prosthetics, the implant attaches to the
          bones of the remaining extremities via osseointegration, which
          essentially extends the skeleton to a point where a prosthesis can be
          attached. Whereas in mind-controlled prosthetics, the key difference
          is that the electrical sensors used in myoelectric prostheses attach
          to the skin through an external socket, whereas the new mind-control
          osseointegration prostheses have all the wiring under the skin.
          Conventional prosthetic limbs can be uncomfortable and painful. A lot
          of people throw them away.
          <br />
          <br />
          In the past, these prosthetics came with hefty price tags which were
          not affordable to many, but due to the technological advancement made
          by mankind, mainly using 3D printing, it will be sold to them at a
          price half of the traditional ones. These advances are a huge win for
          people who have lost a limb, who have long had limited opportunities
          to use prosthetics, many of whom have been uncomfortable and painful.

          <br />
          The term Biomechanics combines bio, which means life and mechanics,
          which is the study of the action of forces. The term “biomechanics” is
          used to describe the application of mechanics to biological systems.
          It can be defined in simple words as science involving the study of
          the mechanical aspects of living organisms or as the application of
          mechanical principles in the study of living organisms.

          <br />
          Sports biomechanics involves a detailed analysis of sports movements
          to minimize the risk of injury and improve athletic performance. It
          refers to the description, complete assessment and analysis of the
          movements of the human body during sport activities. In simpler words,
          sports biomechanics is a science that explains how and why the human
          body moves that way.

          When we talk about exploring the area of biomechanics and human
          movements , it is useful to consider the three laws of Newton.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Newton’s First Law: </strong> An object in motion will tend to
          stay in motion and an object at rest will tend to stay at rest unless
          acted upon by a force. For example, the body of an athlete sprinting
          down the field will tend to stay in motion unless muscular forces can
          overcome the inertia.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Newton’s Second Law: </strong> This law states that every
          action has an equal and opposite reaction. For instance, the force
          created by the legs pushing against the ground has a reaction that the
          ground pushes back and helps the player move forward in the ground.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Newton’s Third Law: </strong> It precisely explains how much
          motion will be experienced by a force. For example, When a ball is
          thrown or kicked, it tends to travel in the direction of the line of
          action of the applied force. Similarly, the greater the amount of
          force applied, the greater the speed the ball has.
          <br />
          <br />
          Momentum is also related to Newton's second law. Linear momentum is
          created when an athlete sprints in a straight track. In tennis, the
          angular momentum generated by the coordinated action of the body
          segments is transmitted to the linear momentum of the racket at the
          time of impact.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Center of Gravity:</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          <img
            src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/asmeportal.appspot.com/o/Blogs%2F25d.png?alt=media&token=6db465a2-c36f-4807-8642-7b1ab285e4b1"
            alt=""
            style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto" }}
          />
          <br />
          <br />
          Center of Gravity can be defined as the point at which all the parts
          of an object are equally balanced.
          <br />
          <br />
          In the case of humans, the center of gravity can change depending on
          the position of their body.
          <br />
          <br />
          As the image shows, the center of gravity of a normal human being
          standing straight is around the area of their navel. Whereas a person
          stretching their hands above has the center of gravity above their
          navel and a person bending down has center of gravity below.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Balance of the players:</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          Balance is the player's ability to control their equilibrium or
          stability. The balance of a person is directly proportional to the
          size of the base. Their balance will depend on their weight. Greater
          the weight, more the balance. If the center of gravity is lower, the
          balance of the person is more.
          <br />
          <br />
          Static balance is the ability to maintain stability and orientation
          when the body is at rest and the center of gravity is above the base
          of support. Dynamic balance is the ability to maintain stability and
          orientation when the body is in motion and the center of gravity is
          above the base of support.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Correct Biomechanics:</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          As mentioned above, proper biomechanics can ensure efficient movement
          and reduce the risk of injury but improper technique can cause
          abnormal biomechanics that can lead to injuries. For example, in
          cricket, mixed bowling actions can lead to stress fractures. An
          athlete can face hamstring injuries due to Anterior pelvic tilt.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Injury Management using Biomechanics:</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          Understanding that the shoulder can be the biomechanical cause of, for
          example, pelvic injuries, and vice versa, is a major advance in the
          treatment of injuries and back pain. Therefore, if there is an injury
          that does not respond to treatment, biomechanical stress elsewhere in
          the body may be putting pressure on this vulnerable area. Finding
          biomechanical causes can be important in returning to work and
          exercise and minimizing the risk of the same injury occurring again.
          <br />
          <br />
          Regular sports massages help prevent injuries and injuries caused by
          overuse. Massage should play a very important role in any exercise
          program used by athletes and recreational athletes. Sports massage
          helps in relaxation and works perfectly with the biomechanics
          re-aligning process.
          <br />
          <br />
          All sports have specific biomechanics that play a critical role in
          determining their performance and the way they are played. Running,
          cycling, baseball, tennis, badminton and swimming all have different
          biomechanics that can be followed to improve performance and
          technique. A proper coach skilled in biomechanics can teach these.
          This will also help in preventing numerous injuries that are generally
          encountered in sports and exercise. Simple factors like speed or angle
          or turn may lead to major injuries that can be avoided by having a
          proper knowledge of these biomechanics.

          <strong>Introduction</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          The most commonly asked question is Why can’t we just use
          fuel-efficient and cheap car engines in our airplanes? The answer is
          that the best automobile engine in the world is somewhat still poor
          for aircraft engines because car engines are designed to provide quick
          bursts of relatively high power output for acceleration, and then only
          modest power output for steady-state cruising. It’s unusual for an
          auto engine to operate anywhere near its redline rpm or max-rated
          power output. Airplanes, on the other hand, usually take off and climb
          near 100 percent power output, followed by steady-state cruise often
          at 75 percent power. Aircraft engines are designed to sustain this
          punishment reliably over a typical 2,000-hour service life.
          <br />

          <br />
          <br />
          You can build your own airplane by buying a kit and choosing whichever
          engine you like to fl for the plane. Generally a certified aircraft
          engine will cost on average $15,000 - $30,000. And this is just for
          the 150HP engines and below. If you want power output in the 180 HP
          plus region, then you’re going to shell our more dollars. This is
          where auto conversion engines come in.
          <br />
          <br />
          Auto conversion engines are basically car engines that are retooled
          and used for flying. So why use a car engine to fly airplanes? well
          for one, it’s less expensive to buy and to maintain. This is because
          car engines like Honda are already mass produced and parts/labor are
          available everywhere.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>PROCESS:</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          Let us go a little bit into the process of taking a car engine and
          then you convert it into an airplane engine. Basically the process
          starts by using used engines that doesn't mean junkyard engines, it’s
          basically the latest year of the model engines like 2018 Honda Accord;
          2018 Mitsubishi engines those are the engines that are buyed with two
          to ten thousand miles thinks that where the insurance companies
          decided that the engine is not or car is not rebuildable but the
          engine compartment was never really touched in an accident, obviously
          these cars have been in some kind of an accident where they were hit
          on the side or in the back or even a lot of engine we get shipping
          damage when the cars came in from different countries and things like
          that so that’s how the process starts it uses a technology that
          basically if you had to go and buy it not bolt by bolt would cost
          tremendous amount of money because we can start out with a really nice
          engine that comes in here with the different salvage companies and the
          insurance company to deliver them. We can start the process from an
          engine that’s already assembled that has no damage that has been
          thoroughly checked out put on machine parts and wire harness and ECU
          that operates the engine we can then take for instance the prototype
          approach would be to pick an engine go through the drafting of the
          gearbox the layout of a wire harness table put the engine on the dyno
          and get the proper Pro protocol in the ECU that’s gonna operate the
          engine for instance with the turbo engines and the 130 it’s very
          sophisticated process because those are direct injected, its a port
          injected so that the process is more traditional and an easier to do.
          So, that’s the basic steps that happen.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>MATERIALS Used & PROCEDURE:</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          Engines that are made in mass produced, you can buy parts everywhere,
          anywhere and for a reasonable price so back to Viking an engine called
          a Viking 110 and it was a 1.5 litre Honda and it was really designed
          to be lighter than in the car machined, pretty much every part of that
          engine other than the crankshaft and the block, some chain housing
          cover plate with engine mounts for aircraft use and so forth and ended
          up being a good engine was out.
          <br />
          <br />
          <img
            src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/asmeportal.appspot.com/o/Blogs%2F24b.JPG?alt=media&token=a5cd7b8f-c4b3-49d1-b7c3-c576ae0aa789"
            alt=""
            style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto" }}
          />
          <br />
          <br />
          It was made and used for many years and then decided that it lost
          sight of the idea of keeping as much of the car engine as possible.
          So, now went on another search for the lightest of engines rather than
          taking one and making it lighter, so just picked an engine that was
          smaller which is the Mitsubishi 90 horse and left honda fit engine
          upright the way it is in the car, in fact all engines from 1:10 was
          the only horizontal engine(it was a upright engine) that was made to
          lay horizontal, then decided to make a new gearbox with the 3rd gear
          and idler gear and because we now can raise the thrust line there was
          no need to lay the engine on its side which was a game changer for our
          business because now the engine could be produce quickly reliably and
          they could be just like they sit and operate in the car meaning that
          when someone wants an engine its instantly done means that can be
          shipped out and just simplify the process and made that whole thing
          easier and currently at Viking the current production line is like I
          mentioned 90 horse derived from a Mitsubishi car the 130 horsepower
          which is a Honda fit and the 150-380 horsepower which is all the same
          engine but we can take out of different horsepower depending on the
          amount of boost that were those engines are producing because that
          particular engine is turbocharged engine.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>
            DIFFERENCE b/w 130 Horsepower fit and Turbocharged [1.5 Lt.]:
          </strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          The difference between the 130 horsepower fit engine which is also a
          1.5 liter and turbocharged 1.5 liter is that the 1.5 turbo is a
          different animal altogether. Honda produced a turbo engine from
          scratch it happens to have 1.5 liter like the fit engine but
          everything else is different it has sodium filled exhaust valves, the
          exhaust is on the opposite side of the cylinder head, it’s a different
          block altogether different bringings so forth and so on so there’s an
          engine that’s made and designed by Honda to be turbocharged comes with
          a very nice digital wastegate for the turbocharger which we've
          programmed through our ECU so the basic engine can take care of itself
          even at attitude you want to maintain 4 inches or 4 pounds of boost
          the engine will do that automatically by itself and pretty
          sophisticated nice engine.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>CONCLUSION</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          One question that comes to our mind is: Why couldn’t our car engine
          run at, say, 2,700 rpm all the time, about the same as that of many
          piston aircraft engines producing full power? Reciprocating aircraft
          engines generally spin a propeller via direct drive, with the prop
          essentially bolted to the crankshaft. Typically, piston aircraft
          engines produce peak power output at a redline near 2,700 rpm. But
          compared with car engines, aircraft engines produce gobs of torque at
          relatively low rpm. Auto engines, on the other hand, usually produce
          very little torque at those settings, while also relying on liquid
          cooling. They’re generally designed to produce their peak power at
          settings above 6,000 rpm, and so to work they need a reduction gear
          box. Still, that hasn't stopped some manufacturers from adapting
          automotive engines for aviation duty, and often with impressive
          results. Austro Engine did it with its super-efficient AE300 turbo
          diesel based on a Mercedes-Benz engine. Viking Aircraft Engines of
          Edgewater, Florida, meanwhile, has adapted the engine from the tiny
          Honda Fit for use in LSAs. Its liquid-cooled gasoline engine
          (pictured) produces 110 hp at 5,800 rpm and burns just 3.5 gph at its
          economy cruise setting.

          <strong>Introduction</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          Technology around us is changing at a rapid rate. Everyday something
          is emerging in the market which is making our life much easier, which
          helps us carry out our work in a more efficient manner. Moreover, it
          is also reducing human interference required to execute tasks. Same is
          the case with the medical field. It is appalling to know that lakhs of
          people die all over the world just because of medical errors, some of
          which are likely preventable.
          <br />
          <br />
          This becomes a very good reason for engineers to build a robot which
          can prevent these mistakes which might look small but aren't. Robots
          are tireless and they can perform precise movements better than human
          hands. Here is some insight into how we can use robots to reduce human
          error and save lives of people.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>TYPES OF ROBOTS IN MEDICAL FIELD:</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>SURGICAL ROBOTS:</strong> This technology helps the surgeon to
          control the arm of the robot through a computer. The robot generally
          consists of a camera arm along with a mechanical arm consisting of the
          equipements. The computer console provides the surgeon a better view
          of the site and control than the traditional one.
          <br />
          <br />

            style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto" }}
          />
          <br />
          <br />
          For instance, ‘Da Vinci’. It is one of the most famous surgical
          robots. It helps in minimal invasive surgery, this in turn helps
          faster recovery of the patient. However, it should be noted that the
          robot does not perform the surgery. It is the surgeon who performs the
          surgery with the help of the console. It provides a magnified, 3D high
          definition view of the surgical area.
          <br />
          <br />
          <img

            style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto" }}
          />
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>EXOSKELETON:</strong> This is an electromechanical device that
          helps wheelchair patients to walk, stand and climb stairs. This
          reduces the involvement of the physiotherapist as they don't have to
          assist the patient, and also reduces the energy required by the
          patient to move their joints as now that has been managed by the
          electromechanical device. It also makes the patient more independent
          and free to move on their own. The exoskeleton works with the help of
          actuators.
          <br />
          <br />
          An example of this is the Hybrid Assistive Limb(HAL). It is the
          world's first wearable cyborg(a fictional person). We are able to move
          our muscles when our brain sends signals to the muscles. These signals
          are also available on our skin as bioelectric signals(BES) which are
          sensed by the sensors attached in the HAl and that tries to coordinate
          with the motion of the patient
          <br />

          />
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>CARE ROBOTS:</strong> Everyone on this earth is not privileged
          with a family. Hence for such people engineers have created a care
          robot which will take care of them post surgery. They will help them
          get into and out of the bed. They are expected to perform more complex
          tasks like reminding the patient to take medicines, record
          temperature, their hygiene, providing emotional support and also
          interacting with them.
          <br />
          <br />
          On this idea, the PARO robot was developed by the Japanese. It is one
          of the most advanced interactive robots in the world. It is a
          therapeutic robot, covered in soft white fur and performs some of the
          functions as a real pet. It consists of 5 types of sensors: tactile,
          light, temperature, audition and posture sensors.

          <strong>HOSPITAL ROBOTS:</strong> In this world of developing
          technology, it is not justified for humans to perform tasks which can
          be easily carried out by robots, especially in hospitals where there
          should be regular observation of the patient. Hence robots have been
          developed for the same. They can now deliver medicines and laboratory
          specimens within a hospital environment, so that the nurses can be
          with the patients all the time. These robots can also be used to clean
          the hospital.
          <br />
          <br />
          One such robot is the ‘TUG AETHON’. It performs the job of delivering
          food and other items and complete various transporting tasks. This
          reduces the load of the hospital staff and helps them focus more on
          the admitted patient and look after them more efficiently. It has a
          payload of 1000 pounds. It has a lot of sensors like the sonar,
          infrared sensors which helps them move safely in the hospital and
          prevents collision with the hospital staff and visitors.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>CONCLUSION</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          Robots are made by humans to make their life easier. In the last 10
          years, the rapid increase of Iot has made it possible for robots to
          assist us in every sphere of our life. Same is the case with the
          medical field, and so this is how robots appeared in this field as
          well. They provide several advantages such as high precision and
          better comfort.
          <br />
          <br />
          Doctors all over the world are looking very optimistic with this
          development and are trying to promote it. They are even hoping for the
          emergence of more advanced robots which can help them in surgery, and
          engineers all over the world are working day and night to achieve
          this. These operations are expensive at this point of time, but they
          are estimated to be cheaper over the period of time, and everyone will
          have access to this facility.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>
            Thus beyond everything, robotics will definitely help to improve the
            future of medicine, as it does now ,but it will happen step by step
            while overcoming all the actual obstacles.

          <strong>Introduction</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          From the Flintstones and their whimsical contraptions to Tony Stark’s
          equally fanciful ones, there lies an underlying theme that holds us
          captivated. The urge to create something. The desire to fashion our
          wildest imaginations into tangible objects within our grasp.
          Mechatronics is a field of engineering which allows you to do exactly
          this. Fusing together concepts of robotics, electronics, computer,
          telecommunications and virtually any other branch of engineering
          imaginable, you can learn to breathe life into your imagination right
          from a robot that fetches you the remote to a minion for global
          domination. It just takes a little effort, time and resources.
          <br />
          <br />
          If that sounds like your cup of tea, read on!
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Scratch</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          The first obstacle you’ll face when you delve into mechatronics is
          knowing where to begin. The sheer volume of information available and
          choices to make are easily intimidating.. Mechatronics is defined by
          its constant evolution and that will always be the case. In this
          article we shall explore the bare-bones of what it takes to build a
          mechatronics system. Before you go further, I’d encourage you to hold
          the picture of your dream robot in your mind’s eye (As crazy as you
          please, I’m not judging!) and piece it together as you read further.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Microprocessors</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          The microprocessor or microcontroller is the ‘Brain’ of any
          mechatronics system, and it’s likely to be the first thing you buy
          when you go on your maiden mechatronics shopping spree.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you're like me you’ve probably heard the terms Microprocessor and
          Microcontroller used interchangeably, with brand names like Arduino or
          Raspberry pi following them. While this is fairly common, there are
          several differences between both. For now, here’s what you need to
          know:
          <br />
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-o-right"></i> Microprocessors are IC
              chips containing only a CPU. All peripherals like RAM/ROM etc…
              have to be attached externally. All Raspberry Pi’s with the
              exception of Pico, are Microprocessors
            </li>
            <li>
              <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-o-right"></i> Microcontrollers are
              the entire package. These are essentially computers on a chip, and
              come equipped with a CPU as well as fixed amounts of RAM,ROM etc…
              All Arduino boards come equipped with Microcontrollers (ATmega
              typically).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <br />
          Which of these you end up choosing, depends primarily on your
          product's requirement and your expertise. If you’re a beginner with
          some knowledge of electronics hoping to build a simple system (think
          remote-fetching bot), an Arduino UNO, or a clone if you’re on a budget
          will suffice. Arduino manufactures boards that are versatile and easy
          to use. The UNO board has 32Kb memory, 2Kb ROM and a CPU, with 14
          digital I/O pins, 6 Analog input pins and a USB connection for
          transferring your Cde. The Arduino Mega with twice the number of Pins
          is also a great choice if you’d like more flexibility or have a
          propensity to blow them out by mismatching the voltage.
          <br />
          <br />
          Once you’ve obtained a board, it’s fairly easy to figure out. Download
          and Install the Arduino IDE into your PC, Plug in the board using the
          USB provided and get to work. Here’s a figure showing you where
          everything is on an UNO board.
          <br />
          <br />
          That said, since the Arduino is a Microcontroller with Inbuilt memory
          and storage, it’s capabilities are rather limited. If you have a
          decent knowledge of Linux and your Dream Bot needs to Analyse data or
          make complex decisions, Raspberry Pi’s Microprocessor range is what
          you need to be looking into. Whatever you choose, there is an
          abundance of information available at your fingertips!
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Sensors</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          <img
            src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/asmeportal.appspot.com/o/Blogs%2F22d.png?alt=media&token=30181215-416c-419c-8cac-4e780a7849db"

          />
          <br />
          <br />
          Here’s where the real fun begins. If the microprocessor is the Brain
          of the system, sensors are it’s eyes, ears and everything in between.
          Exploring the market for the sensors that fit your needs is as
          exciting as an Easter-egg hunt, and since most sensors have become
          incredibly affordable over the past decade, feel free to pile them
          onto your cart.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you’ve selected a processor for your Dream bot, now is the time to
          choose the sensors. For any mechatronic system to function, it must
          take in information from the world around us, process this information
          in a meaningful way, and carry out a response. Sensors are crucial to
          the first stage of this process.
          <br />
          <br />
          Think about the process your robot needs to accomplish, and what
          information it needs to do so. If it needs to navigate across a
          cluttered room, it requires information on proximity or even motion.
          If it needs to respond to a voice command, it must be able to process
          sound waves. Here are a few commonly used sensors, pair them to extend
          their range of applications.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Actuators</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          Once you’ve got your sensors hooked to the processor/controller, your
          system is now capable of reading it’s environment- all it needs are a
          few motors and moving parts to do what you want it to. If the
          processor acts as the brain, and sensors as the sense organs,
          Actuators are the muscles of your bot. They are responsible for
          converting some form of energy into controlled motion. Actuators in a
          mechatronic system are typically driven by electricity from a power
          source which is controlled by the processor. There are 2 broad
          categories of actuators : Linear and Rotary ones. Rotary actuators are
          commonly known as motors.
          <br />
          <br />
          <img
            style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto" }}
            src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/asmeportal.appspot.com/o/Blogs%2F22e.png?alt=media&token=0c2fa185-67cd-4b29-9290-5e244bb09913"
            alt=""
          />
          <br />
          <br />
          Each motor functions on the same principles but have minor differences
          that make them suitable for certain applications. Servo motors are
          very adaptable to code, while Stepper motors allow for high precision
          movement. Unlike processors and sensors, which you can pick out before
          starting work, choosing your actuator(s) requires a careful
          mathematical analysis of the required motion beforehand.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you’ve been following along your dream bot probably looks a little
          less illusory right now. But the final product is still far from
          finished. To breathe life into your creation, you’ll need to read up a
          whole lot of documentation on the components you’re using, write pages
          of code, and spend a frustrating amount of time figuring out what
          doesn’t work. But with a little patience and a lot of therapeutic
          swearing, you’ll be well on your way to global domination.

          A good tyre means a lot when the nearest assistance is a million miles
          away. As the missions to outer space searching for life on other
          planets, satellites are getting more and more complex by the day
          everything has to be made more intelligent. That includes the very
          basic wheel. During the recent times of travel of the rover curiosity
          on mars lot of damage was incurred on the rover wheels. It was clearly
          evident that there is a strong need for the development of wheels for
          the future missions.
          <br />
          <br />
          <img
            style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto" }}
            src="https://external-preview.redd.it/0qoB9XCU0CcIdWZQ6NVanYfQs8_1FrYNK5NLTmXy6Eg.jpg?auto=webp&s=0e9937f63569ffd101de7ff4f7b06bddea6d151a"
            alt=""
          />
          <br />
          <br />
          One might wonder why it is necessary to develop a new wheel when we
          can use a normal wheel. It is not recommended because filling the tyre
          with air is a problem in space and adding a gas tank especially for
          this also increases the weight of the rover. The other problem is if
          the tyre gets punctured there will be no one around to fix it.
          <br></br>
          Things one needs to remember when one is making a rover wheel are, its
          weight, its strength and its resiliency. One such wheel was developed
          by NASA’s Glenn research centre using the shape memory alloy Nitinol.
          This a tyre totally balanced over raw strength of the material unlike
          normal types requiring air to hold the structure.
          <br />
          <br />
          Nitinol is a nickel titanium alloy which has shape memory properties
          below a set temperature and super elastic properties above it. The
          shape memory is the property of the alloy which allows the material to
          get back to its set shape at a certain point of temperature called
          transformation temperature even when it’s totally deformed. And above
          this temperature it has super elastic properties meaning it can handle
          higher stresses than normal metals do. The transformation temperature
          can be set by varying the ratio of nickel and titanium. And the shape
          can be set by annealing at 500˚-600˚c and rapidly cooling it.
          <br />
          <br />
          All the rover wheels used for mars missions up until now are rigid and
          have low elasticity so they get damaged easily. So, the nitinol wheels
          are one of the solutions because of their high elasticity. The nitinol
          mesh can handle up to 30 times the deformation of that of a
          conventional spring steel mesh.
          <br />
          <br />
          When climbing sharp rocks the stress is increased at the point of
          contact making it more prone to deformation. At this point the rigid
          wheels are punctured but the nitinol wheels are deformed and reverted
          back to their original shape, thanks to its super elastic nature. They
          are almost acting like adding shock absorbers providing a smoother
          ride for the rover in the rocky terrain. The wheel is made of a spring
          mesh which allows the wheel to be lighter and have higher traction and
          durability.
          <br />
          <br />
          With many qualities like super elasticity and shape memory its uses
          are not only limited to space. We may also expect these wheels to be
          on off road vehicles because they are air free hence no fear of
          getting a puncture. These are also used for medical purposes like in
          super elastic needles dentistry and stents. Interesting isn’t it, what
          do you think about it?

    title: "Why are Billionaires interested in space?",
    description: (
      <div class="container" style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
        <p>
          We all saw Jeff Bezos, one of the world’s richest people, just had his
          best day after traveling hundreds of miles above Earth’s surface in a
          spaceship. Before him, we saw Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic
          Company also take a space flight. So why are these billionaires so
          interested in space?
          <br></br> <br></br>
          Each of these billionaires claim to have been enchanted by the ideas
          of space travel ever since childhood, other than that in terms of
          business. One reason all those billionaires are spending billions in
          the aerospace industry is the profit, in that sector alone. So let's
          shift our focus to SpaceX, founded in 2002. It is an American space
          transportation services, aerospace manufacturer, and communications
          company. This revolved around the notion of reducing space
          transportation costs, hence enabling the colonization of Mars. Now,
          SpaceX is valued at $74 billion in 2021!
          <br></br> <br></br>
          There are also several smaller private companies that have shown
          interest in the largely unexploited space business. By some estimates,
          investment in commercial space ventures has doubled from last one year
          alone. Even the public market has been tapped in to fund space travel.
          <br></br> <br></br>
          This begs the question, instead of spending billions of dollars paying
          for an exclusive space flight, why can’t they help in ways that will
          benefit in our present time hardships like securing vaccines for
          billions of poor people or saving millions of people from starving.
          So, it will not affect day-to-day budgeting of billionaires. Or on the
          other hand, why don’t we make sustainable development on our earth
          itself, so that we can share our resources to our future generation.
          Why move to other planets, at all?
          <br></br> <br></br>
          Supporters of these privately funded exploitation of space, debated
          that many technologies such as cars and telephones were once seen as
          symbols of social status too before they eventually became mass
          products. Also, the aeroplanes which we travel today were the product
          of privately funded efforts which benefited mankind. Another reason is
          that there will soon be a time when the resources on earth get
          depleted, which can lead to a catastrophe leading to a new habitat on
          a new planet.
          <br></br> <br></br>
          Setting up human colonies on other planets will also bring into issues
          such as distinction of property rights. Many have already warned about
          the risk of a few billionaires establishing a region in space, but
          others believe that even such colonisation does not cause any risk. In
          order to employ their own dominance, governments should try to
          regulate private companies from setting up such territories.

          The main reason drones have become so popular and common is their low
          cost of manufacturing and ease of control. They can be easily deployed
          from any place in any condition and can take off and land vertically
          and have the ability to hover at a place. They also reduce the
          dependance on human resource on a large scale like losing a drone is
          better than losing a life of a precious soldier. But it may become a
          cause of concern as it may result in unemployment. They are also
          available in various shapes and sizes. Drones are so effective in
          whatever they do that all the planet exploration missions are
          accomplished by drones.

          They have their own disadvantages also, recently there have been many
          instances of attacks carried out using drones, they are being used for
          infiltration or for spying. Drones have been used to spread terrorism
          as they can be modified to do all sorts of task’s, be it capturing a
          video or detonating a bomb. Attacks carried out using Drones are very
          dangerous as the operator is hard to locate, and can be carried out
          very silently.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          As drones are a new concept in the aeronautical industry there are no
          rigid and foolproof laws which restrict the use of drones and their
          parameters. There are loopholes which are being taken advantage of.
          There is legislative uncertainty in the use of drones. There should be
          tracking devices in every drone made for commercial use and
          accompanied by a proper document to certify the flyer of the drone
          like a driving license. There should be proper rules like in the case
          of airplanes. A special unit of the ATC should be created to
          continuously track only drones. Drones are a boon to us by the modern
          aeronautical industry but they can become a bane too. So, we can
          expect many and frequently modified laws on the use of drones in the
          upcoming years.

          It still feels like it was yesterday that SpaceX announced its plans
          for building reusable rockets. They were mocked at, but continued to
          move towards their goal of making space travel a commercial venture.
          It was during the December of 2015, that the world witnessed the first
          successful recovery of the first stage of an orbital launch rocket.
          The Falcon 9 rockets (named after the Millennium Falcon from Star
          Wars) have created a new milestone in space exploration by achieving
          this feat. In March 2017, the first re-flight of a landed first stage
          took place and since then SpaceX has sent multiple rockets which used
          the recovered first stage systems.

          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Another extraordinary feat in this field was achieved through the
          launch of the Falcon Heavy rocket. In February 2018, SpaceX launched a
          Tesla roadster with a dummy dubbed ‘Starman’ in the driver’s seat
          aboard the rocket and successfully deployed it into orbit. This also
          acted as proof of concept that the reusable launching system could be
          modified to carry heavy and arguably, even super-heavy payloads into
          orbit.

          The next step towards such systems will be the Starship rocket which
          is being designed such that both the stages will be reusable. This
          would truly be extraordinary as the second stage contains many
          hardware components of the rocket. If it turns out as it should, these
          rockets will be capable of delivering resources to Mars.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Now, let us look into the important question. Why are reusable rockets
          considered so important? As everyone might know, a typical rocket
          costs around a few hundred million to build and launch. But having
          reusable rockets, it becomes possible to lower the cost per run. With
          the starship system, it has been estimated that the cost could be
          brought down to a few million dollars. All such reductions make it
          possible to bring space exploration closer to the general public.

          As the original plan of SpaceX was to send humans to mars, such
          advancements in technology, bring that dream closer to reality. These
          marvelous feats of physics and engineering being pioneered at SpaceX
          truly have changed the way we look at space travel. As the reliability
          of the Falcon 9s has been proven time and again, we can be sure that
          these starship rockets will also turn out to achieve their goals in
          the near future. It has also been estimated that with a bit of
          service, most of these reusable stages can perform well over 100
          flights in their lifetime.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          As we edge closer and closer to space travel becoming a common
          activity, we truly have to appreciate the long way that we have come
          from initial rockets which couldn’t even break through the atmosphere
          to now when we can aim towards travelling to new planets. All of this
          just goes to show that if time and science are used to the fullest,
          humans can achieve various tasks which were once just dreams.

    title: "What is CRISPR?",
    description: (
      <div class="container" style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
        <p>
          Gene editing , also sometimes known as genome editing, is a method of
          altering or ‘editing’ the DNA of an organism through the help of
          technology. Through this, genetic material can be inserted, removed,
          or changed in composition to make changes in the genome. There have
          been various different ways scientists and researchers have tried
          this. One of the most recent technologies to be developed in the
          CRISPR-Cas9. The word CRISPR stands for ‘Clustered Regularly
          Interspaced short palindrome repeats’ which are a type of bacterial
          defence system that makes CRISPR technology possible. CRISPRs were
          initially discovered in archaea and later in bacteria, and were
          assumed to be defending bacteria from viral attacks. CRISPR consists
          of repeated sequences of genetic code that are interrupted by remains
          of genetic codes of prior invaders, called ‘spacer’ sequences.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          The basic operation of CRISPR is simple: It locates a certain specific
          length of DNA inside a cell and then either alters it.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>A CRISPR ‘spacer’ sequence is said to be transcribed into
          short sequences of RNA. These RNA help guide the system to matching
          sequences of DNA. After locating the DNA, an enzyme produced by CRISPR
          known as ‘Cas9’ attaches itself to The strand of DNA and cuts it. This
          effectively shuts down the desired gene.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          CRISPR as an adaptive Immune system was discovered in the year 1987
          after which three types of CRISPR technological systems were
          developed, namely – Cas3 (type I system), Cas9 (type II system) and
          Cas10 (type III system). The development of these systems is said to
          have begun around 2002, and was unveiled in 2012. Prior to this, the
          method of editing plant or animal genomes costed hundreds of thousands
          of dollars. CRISPR made it possible to carry out this process for much
          cheaper.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          CRISPR is used abundantly in scientific research. There is a very real
          possibility that we may have plants or animals that have had gene
          alteration done by CRISPR in the near future.CRISPR also potentially
          possesses the ability to help create medicines that may prevent many
          diseases.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          The ‘Cas’ protein found in bacteria to be the defenders against
          viruses. ‘Cas9’ is one of these proteins that have been researched and
          widely used by scientists. This protein is said to be easily
          programmed to locate and bind to nearly any required sequence. The
          CRISPR Cas9 protein, when introduced into a cell, allows the protein
          to attach to the guide RNA and travel throughout the length of the DNA
          until it locates and attaches itself to that part of the DNA.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          In its initial stages, CRISPR Cas9 was first tried out in 2008 to
          improve the immunity of bacteria against viruses. This experiment
          helped food manufacturers to produce cheese and yoghurt. Further on,
          this system was used by Scientists to try and alter genes of animals
          such as mice, rats, pigs and zebrafish. Scientists even reported
          successful use of this technology on mice to eliminate muscular
          dystrophy and cure a rare liver disease. There is ongoing research and
          investigation to genetically modify insects so that insect-borne
          diseases such as malaria and lyme disease can be stopped. Similarly,
          it opens up the possibility of creating cures for high cholesterol,
          HIV, Huntington’s disease and more.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Although there are numerous advantages, applications and possible
          benefits of the CRISPR technologies, there are some issues that come
          up as well. For example, there has been an attempt to use this
          technology to alter human embryos, which has caused a debate about how
          ‘ethical’ this highly advanced method of gene modification is.
          Moreover, comes the question of how safe this technology is. Although
          by far the most advance, CRISPR is still in its very early stages. It
          is believed by scientists that altering one part of the genome may
          sometimes automatically trigger a change in a different part. Such an
          issue has to be tackled before even thinking of applications toward
          human cells.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          The areas of applications are truly limitless when it comes to genome
          editing thanks to CRISPR. It has single handedly made research areas
          that were previously nearly impossible to explore very easy and cheap
          to explore. But will it always lead to progress in medical sciences or
          will it create trouble? Only time can tell.

          Indian renewable energy sector is the fourth most attractive renewable
          energy market in the world. India was ranked fifth in wind power,
          fifth in solar power and fourth in renewable power installed capacity,
          as of 2019.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Installed renewable power generation capacity has gained pace over the
          past few years, posting a CAGR (Compound annual growth rate) of 17.33%
          between FY16-20. With the increased support of Government and improved
          economics, the sector has become attractive from investors
          perspective. As India looks to meet its energy demand on its own,
          which is expected to reach 15,820 TWh by 2040, renewable energy is set
          to play an important role. The government is aiming to achieve 227 GW
          of renewable energy capacity (including 114 GW of solar capacity
          addition and 67 GW of wind power capacity) by 2022, more than its 175
          GW target as per the Paris Agreement. The government plans to
          establish renewable energy capacity of 500 GW by 2030.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          As of November 30, 2020, the installed renewable energy capacity stood
          at 90.39 GW, of which solar and wind comprised 36.91 GW and 38.43 GW,
          respectively. Biomass and small hydro power constituted 10.14 GW and
          4.74 GW, respectively. By December 2019, 15100 megawatts (MW) of wind
          power projects were issued, of which, projects of 12,162.50 MW
          capacity have already been awarded. Power generation from renewable
          energy sources in India reached 127.01 billion units (BU) in FY20.
          With a potential capacity of 363 GW and with policies focused on the
          renewable energy sector, Northern India is expected to become the hub
          for renewable energy in India.

          <br></br>
          <strong>ROAD AHEAD</strong>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          The Government is committed to increased use of clean energy sources
          and is already undertaking various large-scale sustainable power
          projects and promoting green energy heavily. In addition, renewable
          energy has the potential to create many employment opportunities at
          all levels, especially in rural areas. The Ministry of New and
          Renewable Energy (MNRE) has set an ambitious target to set up
          renewable energy capacities to the tune of 227 GW by 2022, of which
          about 114 GW is planned for solar, 67 GW for wind and other for hydro
          and bio among other. India’s renewable energy sector is expected to
          attract investment worth US$ 80 billion in the next four years. About
          5,000 Compressed Biogas plants will be set up across India by 2023.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          It is expected that by 2040, around 49% of the total electricity will
          be generated by renewable energy as more efficient batteries will be
          used to store electricity, which will further cut the solar energy
          cost by 66% as compared to the current cost. Use of renewables in
          place of coal will save India Rs. 54,000 crores (US$ 8.43 billion)
          annually. Renewable energy will account for 55% of the total installed
          power capacity by 2030.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          As per the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) estimates, by 2029-30,
          the share of renewable energy generation would increase from 18% to
          44%, while that of thermal is expected to reduce from 78% to 52%.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          India is facing an acute energy scarcity which is hampering its
          industrial growth and economic progress. Setting up of new power
          plants is inevitably dependent on import of highly volatile fossil
          fuels. Thus, it is essential to tackle the energy crisis through
          judicious utilization of abundant the renewable energy resources, such
          as biomass energy, solar energy, wind energy and geothermal energy.
          Apart from augmenting the energy supply, renewable resources will help
          India in mitigating climate change. India is heavily dependent on
          fossil fuels for its energy needs. Most of the power generation is
          carried out by coal and mineral oil-based power plants which
          contribute heavily to greenhouse gases emission.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          The average per capita consumption of energy in India is around 500 W
          (Data-2016), which is much lower than that of developed countries like
          USA, Europe, Australia, Japan etc. However, this figure is expected to
          rise sharply due to high economic growth and rapid industrialization.
          The consumption of electricity is growing on the worldwide basis.
          Energy is a necessity and sustainable renewable energy is a vital link
          in industrialization and development of India. A transition from
          conventional energy systems to those based on renewable resources is
          necessary to meet the ever-increasing demand for energy and to address
          environmental concerns.

        <p>
          Over the past couple of years, the world has clearly seen the need for
          a more sustainable approach to development. This is particularly
          highlighted and recognized by leaders around the world, and the
          pathway to achieve this was conceptualized by the United Nations. It
          is characterized today as the United Nation Sustainable Development
          Goals (SDG’s). The SDG’s are a set of 17 goals that the participating
          countries would aim to make a reality. The goals were written in a
          very inclusive way, so as to address many problems that plague not
          just the developing countries, but also the developed ones.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          This article will concentrate on one particular aspect of the SDG 11,
          which talks about sustainable cities and communities. Given the
          massive rise in metropolitan cities around the world, it is also seen
          that the development is often accompanied by increased carbon
          emissions, and the increased rate of resource depletion. Thus, nations
          are working toward this particular goal, mainly by constructing ‘Smart
          Cities’ with increased efficiency of public transport.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          One particular aspect that has garnered a lot of interest over the
          years, is the transportation sector, with local government’s trying to
          look for more efficient and sustainable ways of transportation. India
          has taken massive strides forward in this aspect, as it has been long
          theorizing for ways to make travel more sustainable, while trying to
          keep in mind key factors such as the pricing and the population of
          cities.

          />
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          The major policy effort that has taken shape and has been instrumental
          in moving towards sustainable transportation is the National Urban
          Transport Policy (NUTP). This particular policy was drafted in 2006,
          along with the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission(JNNURM)
          to complement the NUTP in its policy-based solutions, and served as
          the base documents for several other projects such as the Smart Cities
          and National Electric Mobility Policy. The NUTP was revised in 2014,
          to make way for solutions aiming at a lower carbon footprint, and
          defining city-specific solutions.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          The key objectives of the NUTP were to prioritize the movement and
          transport of more people, and not more vehicles. Thus, emphasis was
          placed on more space for sustainable transport modes such as walking,
          cycling and public transport. It was theorized to provide a much more
          seamless and user-friendly mode of transportation, while emphasizing
          on less time spent on commute.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Looking in depth at the policy solutions, it has instituted multiple
          projects on the basis of feasibility studies that were conducted. The
          studies brought about effective solutions such as the famous Metro
          Projects in cities with congestion and high traffic density, such as
          Bengaluru and Lucknow. These Metro projects have seen immense success
          with the local people, being an affordable and time saving method of
          transportation.
          <br></br> <br></br>
          <img
            style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto" }}
            src="https://shaktifoundation.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/og-transport.png"
            alt=""
          />
          <br></br> <br></br>
          Other projects, such as the Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) in cities
          such as Ahmedabad and Pune have been instituted, which consist of
          dedicated bus lanes with the reach of such a system being across the
          major industrial areas of the city. The success of these projects,
          however, are debatable. While the projected numbers for the BRTS did
          indicate a huge change in the amount of people using such systems, the
          actual numbers indicated otherwise. While the ridership on the BRTS
          increased only by about 12-17% for the 3 years since the inception, it
          was in no way comparable to the growth in the number of personal
          vehicles. There are multiple reasons attributed to this, with the
          criticism often directed toward the maintenance of the bus stations,
          lack of enough funding for expansion, and the infrequency of the
          buses.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Although the NUTP was initially seen as a way and a background on
          building a more sustainable model of transportation along all parts of
          the country, it has hit a few roadblocks with respect to the
          implementation, which has to a large extent remained on paper, or
          fallen short of its expectations. While most cities have been moving
          towards looking into construction of Metro’s, a lot of funding has
          been diverted there. This has left significant lack of funding in
          other mediums of public transport, and even with respect to the
          infrastructure needed for it. Bus bays and bus stands remain in a poor
          state of maintenance, and have not been increased to accommodate for
          the increased footfall. The policy has also failed to account for the
          last mile coverage. This includes the connections between residential
          areas, and localities that are isolated from the city to the bus
          stands and bus bays. These issues have hindered the complete and
          successful implementation of the projects under the NUTP, even after
          its revamp in 2014.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          One positive effect that the NUTP and JNNURM brought about is the
          implementation of new policies that target essential and precise
          aspects of the transportation sector, that these could not
          specifically address. IN 2015, the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and
          Urban Transformation ( AMRUT) was launched, which was directed towards
          smaller cities rather than targeting just the metros. Funds were
          allocated in order to create footpaths, sidewalks and cycling
          facilities. So far, only 14 states have actually used this funding
          though, to enhance multi-level parking facilities and other such
          facilities to enhance ease of transportation.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          The Smart Cities mission, established in 2015 is also another classic
          example of the kind of solutions the NUTP and JNNURM can bring about.
          Particular cities were identified, and funds were allocated to make
          these cities and their spaces much greener with less pollution,
          congestion, and resource depletion, by making design changes and
          transportation changes. The transportation changes mainly looked at
          making the city-centers much more walking and cycling-oriented, and
          using public transport to commute from the city centers to the
          residential areas. While the mission is already underway in cities
          such as Surat, Visakhapatnam, Coimbatore and many more, there is still
          much more to be done.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          The most basic conclusion that can be drawn is that there exists the
          means, efforts and mechanisms to make sure sustainable transportation
          is seen as an achievable goal at least by 2030, as depicted in the UN
          SDGs. However, it is very evident that the policies are not being
          implemented to its fullest, and needs to be considered and understood
          seriously by the state and union government. Given the alarming rates
          of pollution and carbon release, sustainable transportation is seen as
          the fastest way of controlling these rates, and leaving behind a much
          safer environment for the next generation of people.

      <div class="container" style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
        <p>
          Before we begin discussing the budget announced by our honourable
          Finance Minister, I would like to throw light upon the Eisenhower
          Doctrine given by the former US president Dwight Eisenhower. The
          doctrine states that for every $1 invested in infrastructure, you get
          a return of $5. This budget also proposes a model that is aimed at
          getting maximum returns and pulling the economy out of the recession.
          We must acknowledge that just like there was a change in the world
          order post world war, there will be change in world order with
          different economies leading the global supply chains. The post COVID
          era will be totally different from the pre COVID era. This budget will
          prove to be the foundation for India to assume the role of a global
          superpower in the coming decades.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Before we begin assessing the budget it is also important to
          acknowledge the kind of challenge our economy faces due to the
          pandemic. People losing jobs, a large chunk of the population being
          pushed into poverty, MSMEs getting wrecked, Service sector taking a
          massive dip, manufacturing almost dead, consumer demand at a historic
          low and a massive fiscal deficit of 9.5%. Now does the budget pull
          India out of this massive recession?
          <br></br>
          <br></br>I would start by saying that this budget is not aimed at
          boosting immediate consumption but focuses on long term growth. The
          budget focuses on four pillars: healthcare, Asset management &
          disinvestment, Infrastructure and strengthening the financial sector.
          India has been lacking in providing a solid healthcare infrastructure
          to its population. A small example, the total no. of ventilators were
          roughly 49000 for a country with a population of 1.38 billion. 56000
          ventilators have been added alone in the period of March-September
          2020. The government has had a strong focus on healthcare since day 1,
          the fact that the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana (PMJAY) makes
          India home to the world’s largest healthcare program is an evidence of
          that. In this budget, there has been a whopping increase of 137% in
          healthcare allocation compared to previous year’s Budget estimates.
          The pandemic has clearly made us realize the importance of upgrading
          the healthcare of a nation. The allocation made to health will be
          spent in a course of 4-5 years covering various parameters including
          hospitals, infrastructure, Research, and access to clean drinking
          water & sanitation for all.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Second major focus is on disinvestment and asset monetization. There’s
          no debate in the fact that privatization ought to bring growth. Public
          sector enterprises are bodies that gobble up investments and give no
          returns. Privatization will help generate growth that is needed.
          Government will generate revenue by privatizing and monetizing assets
          that give no returns. This will help the government in creating a
          strong balance sheet, and also help those sectors achieve rapid
          growth. The Third major focus is the massive outlay for capital
          expenditure and infrastructure. This as I may sum it up, will ensure
          our economic bounce back. Power infrastructure, complete modernization
          and revamping of railways, creating highways, roads, rural
          infrastructure, agricultural infrastructure, and capex is what was
          needed in these dire times. Construction of infrastructure boosts both
          the primary and secondary industries. Coal, cement, steel and all the
          raw materials required, their processing, and transport will be
          stirred up. Also, engineers and architects for designing and
          manufacturing are needed, and labourers of all sorts are required for
          construction; in short it will stir up employment, people will be
          given wages hence boosting aggregate demand through multiplier effect,
          construction of new roads especially in rural areas will prompt people
          to buy cars thus giving a boost to the auto sector. Since demand for
          cars increases all the industries involved in processing the raw
          materials required in automobiles will be incentivized. This is the
          reason I mentioned the Eisenhower doctrine. Next is about
          strengthening the financial sector. Government will be setting up
          Asset Management Companies and Asset Reconstruction Companies that
          will help India’s overstressed banking sector. PSBs will be
          recapitalized and a deposit insurance is being introduced which is a
          commendable move. FDI limit in insurance has been increased to 75%.
          Stability to the financial sector is immensely important for a healthy
          economy. Other major things include an allocation of 50000 crore for
          Research & Development, a Production Linked Incentive scheme for the
          manufacturing sector that will stir up manufacturing, vehicle
          scrappage policy, a significant allocation for R&D in Hydrogen based
          fuels and renewable energy especially Solar power, allocation for
          exploring the oceans and a massive allocation of 1.42 lakh crores to
          agriculture and allied industries. Now there are a certain important
          misses in this budget that need to be highlighted. First is the lack
          of direct stimulus of the MSMEs. The budget has been doubled for MSMEs
          but still it is not enough. MSMEs have taken a major hit as they
          account for 49% of India’s employment and 30% of exports.
          Formalization of 6 crore MSMEs is pending that has not been taken up.
          Secondly, there has been no importance given to start-ups which is
          utterly disappointing. Budget for defence hasn’t been significantly
          increased which in my opinion is not a big deal but yes, education was
          a setback. With the New Education Policy, reducing the budget is
          unexpected and bizarre. The least the government could have done was
          to keep the allocation unchanged. Hospitality and tourism have been
          shrugged off as if it holds no importance. This industry is one the
          backbone industries of India.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <img
            style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto" }}
            alt=""
            src="http://online.hbs.edu/Style%20Library/api/resize.aspx?imgpath=/PublishingImages/Business-manager-examining-financial-documents-with-colleague-while-preparing-a-budget.jpg&w=1200&h=630"
          />
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          The government assumes that with the pandemic being slowly rolling
          back, this industry will revive on its own through consumer confidence
          due to vaccines and also due to reviving aggregate demand. Now I would
          briefly explain how this budget accompanied with previous reforms will
          pave the path for India to be a superpower in the post corona era if
          implemented correctly. The economic development through privatization
          and infrastructure has been explained. We must now look at how the
          revenue generated will be potentially invested in future. India has
          already been ramping up its healthcare. Now, India looks to spend 6%
          of its GDP on education by 2026. This means that a huge allocation
          might be made in upcoming budgets. The Economic survey of 2020-21
          already pushed for an increase in R&D from 0.7% to 2% of the GDP;
          considering the push given by the government to R&D in this budget,
          and also the importance given to technology, space research, biotech,
          defence and medical research in general; with marine research being
          added this year; R&D appears to be a favourable spending arena. MSMEs
          are bound to see growth despite no relief. This is because previous
          reforms were centred around MSMEs but due to the stressed banking
          sector, many were not able to avail the credit relief promised. Now,
          after the setting up of ARCs and AMCs, credit relief will take place.
          The MSMEs linked to manufacturing will benefit through the PLI scheme.
          The previous packages when rolled out completely alongside the budget
          will prove to be a stimulus for the MSMEs. The three historic farm
          laws, alongside the 1.4 lakh crore allocation and increased credit
          limit of 16.5 lakh crore will take the agricultural sector to new
          heights and pave way for the $5 trillion economy goal. Fisheries,
          animal husbandry and dairy industries will also be ramped up through
          upgradation of infrastructure alongside agriculture. India’s 3 new
          labour codes that have been hailed internationally, are path breaking
          reforms that merge 44 existing labour laws. These laws are set to
          boost confidence among labourers, will employ thousands and strengthen
          legal support for the poor workers. Reforms in IT industries and BPOs
          that normalize work from home and boost efficiency are set to give a
          major push to the IT sector.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Let’s take a look at the energy sector now. Allocation has been made
          up for power infrastructure as mentioned earlier and combined with
          previous reforms, the government has already planned to pump liquidity
          in DISCOMS, Power distribution is set to be privatized, Coal mining
          and evacuation infrastructure will be developed and existing infra is
          to be upgraded. The Indian government has already opened the market
          for Natural gas and aims to make India a gas based economy.
          Significant incentives have been given to Solar energy and renewable
          energy resources since 2015. India has increased its solar energy
          output by leaps and bounds. India aims to produce 175 GW through
          renewable energy alone by 2022. This budget allocates capital for
          Hydrogen based fuel too. This budget alongside India’s record FDI, and
          previous reforms that incentivize made in India technology especially
          in defence will make India’s manufacturing sector achieve new heights.
          Last but not the least, Environment. Reforms in renewable energy are
          set to be beneficial for the environment. The government had already
          set up funds for afforestation and plantation in urban areas and
          artificial regeneration. Let’s now focus on India’s poor. India has
          been uplifting it’s poor through various schemes. Infrastructure
          creation will provide employment and better living standards, existing
          schemes like PMJAY (health program), free gas cylinders, free housing,
          rural electrification and now provision of rural healthcare and access
          to clean water in this budget for all will continuously uplift India’s
          poor in the coming decade.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          The Corona period was a period of reforms for India. To sum it up,
          this budget, in addition to existing schemes, is set to bring reforms
          in health, education, R&D and innovation, Manufacturing,
          infrastructure, IT, agriculture, energy sector and environment. Also,
          not forgetting India’s rapidly evolving defence and space
          technologies. Brace yourself Indians, it’s the post Corona era and the
          world order is set to change in the coming decade.

            “The possibilities of what we can achieve with the materials and
            knowledge we have, have been blown wide open.”
          </span>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Anyone who keeps up with science and tech in the news, remembers the
          buzz Graphene made in the year of its discovery, i.e. 2004 by a
          physics professor and his student. They were playing around with a
          block of graphite and some scotch tape in the University of
          Manchester. Their discovery has completely changed the way engineers
          and scientists look at the limits of modern science and technology.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <strong>What is Graphene?</strong>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Graphene is a single layer of Carbon atoms, tightly packed in a
          hexacomb lattice. Like diamond, graphite and fullerene, it is an
          allotrope of Carbon with sp2 bonded atoms. Layers of graphene stacked
          over one another form graphite.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <strong>Properties of Graphene</strong>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Besides being the lightest compound known to us, it is also one of the
          thinnest at one atom thick. This can be easily demonstrated by
          performing the same experiment done by Professor Andre Geim, by
          rubbing a piece of scotch tape over a block of graphite. The black
          substance that lingers on the tape is graphene. A barrel of graphene
          is weighed around 1.7 kg.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          It is also one of the strongest (100-300 times stronger than steel)
          compounds and is an excellent conductor of heat and electricity. It is
          said that one atom sheet of graphene can hold a 4 kg soccer ball
          easily. It is seemingly the best conductor, with mobility at values of
          more than 200,000 cm2·V−1·s−1.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          All of these properties make Graphene a complete game changer. It can
          revolutionize anything and everything from biochemistry to
          electronics, sensors and imaging to telecommunications.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <strong>What the future for Graphene looks like</strong>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Currently, graphene production is limited because it takes a very
          expensive and complex process of chemical vapor deposition to produce
          high quality graphene that can be used for commercial purposes. This
          method creates a lot of toxic products that are hard to dispose of.
          However, recent studies suggest cleaner methods of producing graphene,
          eliminating the toxic products. The scope for production seems to be
          increasing gradually. There are quite a few investments being made
          into the market and science of the product and what can be made of it.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Research has been expanded to making wearable electronics that are
          washable and can be twisted and stretched out. It is made possible by
          graphene inks that store electrical charge and release it when
          required. The new textile electronic devices are based on low-cost,
          sustainable and scalable dyeing of polyester fabric. The inks are
          produced by standard solution processing techniques.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Graphene is also being used to boost the capacity and charge rate of
          batteries along with their longevity. Currently, while such materials
          as silicone are able to store large amounts of energy, that potential
          amount diminishes drastically on every charge or recharge.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Another use for graphene along similar lines to those mentioned
          previously is that in paint. Graphene is highly inert and acts as a
          corrosion barrier between oxygen and water diffusion. This could mean
          that future vehicles could be made to be corrosion resistant as
          graphene can be made to be grown onto any metal surface (given the
          right conditions).
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          The possibilities with Graphene are truly endless and research is
          underway to make all of them accessible to the common people. But with
          any new promise is the problem of time it takes to make it all happen.
          The same goes for Graphene although the buzz started more than 15
          years ago.

          Hyperloop is a new form of ground transport currently in development
          by a number of companies. It was released by a joint team of SpaceX
          and Tesla in order to transport people or objects at hypersonic
          speeds. It is a tube like structure through which a pod may travel
          resistant free and being energy efficient compared to existing high
          speed rail systems. These pods are designed such that they float on
          air skis similar to that of magnetic levitation. Hyperloop came into
          public consciousness in 2013 when Elon Musk introduced the concept in
          a research paper which posited the Hyperloop as “a fifth mode of
          transport after planes, trains, cars and boats that is:

          Passengers or cargo are loaded into the hyperloop vehicle and
          accelerate gradually via electric propulsion through a low-pressure
          tube. The vehicle floats above the track using magnetic levitation and
          glides at airline speeds for long distances due to ultra-low

          India is the first country to launch the fully functional Hyperloop
          train. The Hyperloop transportation system has been designated a
          “public infrastructure project” by the state of Maharashtra. But the
          major disadvantage with hyperloop is that even if it has a small crack
          in it, outside air would enter the tubes at the speed of sound, and
          the infrastructure would implode. It is said that the Hyperloop would
          be vulnerable to terrorist attacks because it would be difficult to
          monitor 600 km of tubes.

          <strong>VIRGIN HYPERLOOP ONE</strong>

          <br></br>
          An American transportation technology company launched Virgin
          Hyperloop One in 2014, hyperloop’s leading contender, with the aim of
          working to commercialise the high-speed technology. Virgin Hyperloop
          One calls itself-

            “the only company in the world that has successfully tested its
            hyperloop technology at scale, launching the first new mode of mass

          </span>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          The company successfully operated a full-scale hyperloop vehicle using
          electric propulsion and electromagnetic levitation under near-vacuum
          conditions. Eventhough the crtics of hyperloop have said that
          travelling would be uncomfortable, the Virgin Hyperloop One said that
          it would feel as if we are travelling in an elevator or a flight.

          Vehicle-To-Grid(V2G), is similar to regular smart charging. Smart
          charging, also known as V1G charging, enables us to control the
          charging of electric cars in a way that allows the charging power to
          be increased and decreased when needed.

          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          V2G goes one step further, it enables the charged power to also be
          momentarily pushed back to the grid from car batteries to balance
          variations in energy production and consumption. This thus opens new
          opportunities for energy trading and smart energy management. Energy
          should be either used where it’s produced or stored somewhere for
          later usage. Therefore, the growth of renewables inevitably makes our
          energy system more volatile, requiring new ways to balance and stored
          energy to be used.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          The yearly sales of EVs is expected to reach over 20 million before
          2030, which means that we’ll have over 100 million tiny energy
          storages on wheels with an aggregated storage capacity of 5 TWh.
          Vehicle-to-grid technology enables us to make the best use of the
          existing and future population of vehicles. V2G technology considers
          EVs as movable energy storage, as shown in the above picture. Thus,
          V2G technology will solve the problem of energy storage and will help
          in unlocking the energy stored in electric vehicle batteries so that
          households could support the grid when demand peaks. The benefits of
          V2G for buildings are visible when the electricity from car battery is
          used where it is needed the most. V2G helps balance out electricity
          demand and avoid any unnecessary costs for building an electricity
          system.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Since V2G solutions are expected to become a financially beneficial
          feature for energy companies, they provide potential consumers with a
          clear incentive to take part in this venture and encourage several
          others to do the same. So, the consumers may get some benefits for
          adopting the technology at the initial days. According to a research,
          the global V2G technology market will garner revenue around $17.43
          billion by 2027 by recording a compound annual growth rate of 48%
          between 2020 to 2027. By 2050, up to 45% of households would actively
          provide vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services, according to National Grid
          Electricity System Operator.

          V2G technology has some cons too like, it is not a cheap source when
          compared to large power plant power generation. Large scale use of
          these vehicles may lead to technical problems, compatibility issues
          and other difficulties may arise when small scale generations are
          integrated into large power generating units, etc. which is normal for
          initial stages. Every new technology has lots of disadvantages in the
          initial days, but with time, innovation happens and these cons start
          getting eliminated. V2G technology is thus very promising and it can
          clearly be regarded as quite the future that we are all rooting for.

    title: "Hydrogen- An Energy Carrier",
    description: (
      <div class="container" style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
        <p>
          You may have heard many debates on hydrogen energy. Some people think
          that hydrogen is an energy carrier and some think that it’s an energy
          source. So, here comes the question: Hydrogen, energy source or energy
          carrier?To answer this question, we must know what is an energy
          carrier and energy source. Energy carriers are used to deliver energy,
          move and store in a form that can be easily used. A well-known example
          of an energy carrier is Electricity. A source from which useful energy
          can be extracted or recovered either directly or by means of a
          conversion or transformation process (e.g. solid fuels, liquid fuels,
          solar energy, biomass, etc.). Now let’s come to the answer of the main
          question. Hydrogen is an energy carrier, not an energy source and can
          deliver or store a tremendous amount of energy.Hydrogen as an
          important energy carrier in the future has a number of advantages. For
          example, a large volume of hydrogen can be easily stored in a number
          of different ways, including underground hydrogen storage, compressed
          hydrogen in tanks, or through chemical compounds that release hydrogen
          after heating.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Hydrogen is also considered as a high efficiency, low polluting fuel
          that can be used for transportation, heating, and power generation in
          places where it is difficult to use electricity. In some instances, it
          is cheaper to ship hydrogen by pipeline than sending electricity over
          long distances by wire. Hydrogen use today is dominated by industries
          such as oil refining, ammonia production, methanol production and
          steel production. There is significant potential for emissions
          reductions from clean hydrogen because all of this hydrogen is
          supplied using fossil fuels.Hydrogen fuel can be used in many
          different types of transportation either with a fuel cell or in an
          internal combustion engine to eliminate or significantly reduce
          emissions. Fuel cell powered vehicles that turn hydrogen into
          electricity are quiet, efficient and offer the environmental benefit
          of only emitting water.

          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          In transport, the competitiveness of hydrogen fuel cell cars depends
          on fuel cell costs and refueling stations while for trucks the
          priority is to reduce the delivered price of hydrogen. Shipping and
          aviation have limited low-carbon fuel options available and represent
          an opportunity for hydrogen-based fuels. If we see the past, we get to
          know about a timeline.At the early stages, we used to have oil and
          natural gas as the carriers of energy and now we have electricity as
          the energy carrier. So, here comes a question that, why did we skip
          our hydrogen economy after oil and natural gas, and went straight to
          electricity? For hydrogen both, it’s generation and release of its
          carried energy requires a process that invariably involves
          electricity. Now, if we have to make an investment on electricity
          economy to get the hydrogen economy then it does make sense to skip
          the hydrogen economy. Now, if we consider the investment made on
          electricity economy, then here comes a challenge. The greatest
          challenge for the production of hydrogen, particularly from renewable
          resources, is providing hydrogen at a lower cost.

          IEA analysis finds that the cost of producing hydrogen from renewable
          electricity could fall 30% by 2030 as a result of declining costs of
          renewables and the scaling up of hydrogen production. In the longer
          term, solar energy and biomass can be used more directly to generate
          hydrogen as new technologies make alternative production methods cost
          competitive. Producing hydrogen from low-carbon energy is costly at
          the moment.Currently cons are dominating but, we should believe in
          innovation, innovators will definitely do something to make the pros
          to dominate. So, Hydrogen is very promising as a future energy
          carrier.

          Habitability of a planet is essentially the measurement of potential
          of a planet to maintain environments to sustain life. It is one of the
          most important concepts in exoplanet studies. Life may be generated
          naturally on a planet as in case of earth or may have to be
          transferred from another body through the hypothetical concept of
          Panspermia that is life exists throughout the universe distributed by
          asteroids, planetoids, space dust etc. Since earth is the only planet
          known to mankind that sustains life, planetary habitability on other
          planets or satellites is predominantly an extrapolation of conditions
          on Earth and the attributes of the Sun and Solar System of the Milky
          way which appear favorable for life to thrive. The analysis of
          environments which are likely to support life, a comparison is usually
          made between simple, unicellular organisms such as bacteria and large
          multicellular organisms such animals.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Since unicellular life undoubtedly precedes multicellular life in any
          hypothetical tree of life, so we comprehend that if single-celled
          organisms do emerge there is no assurance that greater complexity will
          eventually develop.Factors such as Mass,Radius,Orbit and rotation,
          Geochemistry, Microenvironments and extremophiles and Ecological
          Factors are considered crucial for live to thrive. The ability to
          sustain an atmosphere that supports life is the most important
          requirement for making an exoplanet habitable. But, these exoplanets
          are subjected to space weather in the form of stellar flares,
          emissions of radiation from stars. Stellar flares that are
          fundamentally very similar to solar flares have been found to reduce
          the chances of sustainable habitat on exoplanets. The radiation from
          stellar flares are influenced by continuum emission and almost equal
          amounts of energy has been recorded by the optical, UV, and X-ray
          regions of the spectrum. In solar flares strong emission is rarely
          recorded and a large collection of bright emission lines takes
          prominence. Small flares occur more frequently than large ones and the
          large flares have longer time-scales.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          In a recent study at NYU Abu Dhabi , stars that were most likely to
          host habitable exoplanets based on the calculated erosion rates of the
          planetary atmospheres have been identified.The study led by Research
          Scientist Dimitra Atri of the Center for Space Science has used data
          from NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory
          to present the process of analysing flare emissions. Erosion rates of
          planetary atmospheres were calculated for the research that led to the
          results that more frequent, low energy flares have a greater impact on
          an exoplanet’s atmosphere than less frequent, high energy flares.
          Also, different types of stars extreme ultraviolet radiation (XUV)
          through stellar flares, from different types of stars affect nearby
          space-bodies too. This research has provided novel understanding of
          the habitability of exoplanets. This study also explains the need for
          better numerical modeling of atmospheric escape about how planets
          release atmospheric gasses into space, as the released gases can lead
          to the abrasion of surface atmosphere and the decline of the planet’s
          habitability. According to the statement of scientists involved , the
          research would further continue to expand data sets used to analyse
          stellar flares from a congregation of other stars to see the long-term
          effects of stellar activity, and to identify exoplanets that have more
          potentially habitable conditions.

          The Wright brothers offered a kick start to a new era of
          transportation by developing the first machine that could fly for
          transportation. About 160 years later the first commercial electric
          aircraft took off from Vancouver, Canada built by Manigx Aviation
          thereby establishing a new milestone for present day Aviation.

          The Manufacturing of Small Electricity run planes began in the 1970’s.
          The impact of fossil fuel driven transportation systems on the
          environment- where the important cause for turning towards the
          development of electric driven transport, Electric Transport systems
          do not have an exhaust system making it easier on environment.
          According to the International Aviation Organisation, it is estimated
          that if the current trends of usage of fossil-fuels are used, Aviation
          generated emissions are going to triple in Volume. The usage of these
          new aircrafts would also mean quitter flights and even lower cost of
          maintenance for Airline companies. The usage of electric flights could
          reduce airfares to a cetain extent. Many nations have proposed plans
          for increasing the production of Electric based transportation. The
          recent advancements in the sector of electric transportation indicates
          that by 2025 about 10% of transportation systems will be run by
          electricity. The six seater plane Operated by Harbour Air, also known
          as DHC-2 de Havilland Beaver has a 750 horsepower electric propulsion
          system and is an e-seaplane. It had a weight of about 4 tons and a
          wingspan of over 50 feet making it the largest electric plane to have
          ever flown. The success of this first commercial electrically run
          seaplane indicates that it is possible to run a fleet of such
          aircrafts in modern Aviation.
          <br></br> <br></br>
          All this electric flying technology was unveiled at the Paris Air show
          in the month of June, last year. Magnix and Air Harbour are now
          looking forward to the certification of their jet propulsion system.
          <br></br> <br></br>
          The main challenge faced is to increase the passenger carrying
          capacity of the aircraft. Moreover, the flight lasted only for
          15minutes, as it is difficult to maintain the weight of the aircraft
          and to adopt an onboard battery or an electric power storage system.
          Lithium ion batteries are heavy and have very low energy density
          compared to jet fuel. This major disadvantage makes these planes stick
          to shorter distance flights. Companies such Boeing, Rolls Royce and
          Uber are investing in reducing the size of the battery to make it
          economical.
          <br></br> <br></br>
          In the year 2019, A German company name Lillium had proposed a model
          of a five seater jet taxi of which they expect to begin operations by
          2025.
          <br></br> <br></br>
          The Rolls-Royce is developing an electric jet engine which is claimed
          to reach a speed of 300mph. Rolls Royce expects to built an aircraft
          battery which could power the plane for about 200 miles with one
          charge.
          <br></br> <br></br>A proposal for economically utilising batteries
          onboard was developed by Scientist Dr.Hu in Massachusetts Institute of
          Technology whose invention is a polymer ionic liquid which could be
          used to make batteries that could hold double the energy of Lithium
          ion batteries. But this proposal has not yet become practical.
          <br></br> <br></br>
          Harbour Air too, now aims to develop a commercial fleet of electricity
          run aircrafts which could completely change the face of the Aviation
          sector.

          We have seen it all unfold on our Instagram stories each time
          something bad happens. You open your Instagram, scroll through your
          feed and there it is, someone raging over police brutality in X part
          of the country or some cut throat debate over the rights of someone’s
          body. We take this with rage and anger, because anger it is something
          visceral. And channeling this anger and fury, we take to our own
          Instagram stories and lash it out on the perpetrator. This leads to a
          cycle of events, a ride on which I will take you as you read further.

          Imagine this: Let’s say you want to buy a pair of shoes. Looking all
          over the internet for the perfect fitting, you browse through various
          shopping websites and you look at hundreds of different pairs. You
          might also send a picture to one of your friends, asking them what
          they think of it, about how it would look on you and what not. You
          might take a day or more to deliberate too. What happens is, all the
          data of your browsing history is chained to your phone where you might
          look for those shoes.

          It is common knowledge now to look for something to buy and have it
          show up on your Facebook feed or in Instagram story ads. Let us take
          it a step further by applying this to what kind of content you
          consume: it can be Masterchef videos to whether or not CAA/NRC is
          unconstitutional.
          <br />
          <br />
          Let us assume that you fall in the category that thinks that eating
          pineapple on pizza is cool, as long as it is consented and not forced
          down someone’s throat. There is a good chance that your friends who
          also follow you on social media agree with you and your thoughts
          resonate with them too. Now, the kind of content you consume will also
          fall in line with your idea. You either look for, or ‘accidentally’
          find various pages that also propagate the same idea and you follow
          them. Similar content starts showing up on your Explore feed, in your
          conversations with other people in the virtual spaces and you just
          might ‘speak-up’ about how it is wrong to shame people for their
          choices. You now have, around yourself in the virtual space, created
          inevitably an echo-chamber for yourself.
          <br />
          <br />
          This is just a simple demonstration of how echo chambers work. Sure,
          dissent does follow but just as easy as it is to follow someone and
          ping them up saying that you agree with their train of thought, it is
          equally easier to unfollow someone too; thereby silencing that voice
          of dissent that could have also been a voice of reason. This leads to
          further sealing of this echo chamber that you have built around
          yourself. The short click and instant responses in forms of Likes,
          Comments and Story replies do not help us in introspecting what we put
          out and what we consider to be justice. And no sooner than later the
          pineapple is a rape allegation and the stories you put up are for the
          same, calling for shaming in a fit of rage over the people who shame
          people for shaming someone who likes pineapple on their pizza.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>The root cause of the problem</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          The problem with the so-called speaking up on social media begins from
          the very place we get our news from: social media echo chambers. Each
          of us are rightfully entitled to our own beliefs and ideals, and we
          follow them in a manner that does not open us to other
          interpretations. The conglomeration of ideas on social media leads to
          the formation of public spaces or pages propagating the same. This
          then leads to a large following of people who agree with such ideas,
          eventually blocking out other sources of reason or information,
          leading to the formation of an echo chamber. If the current social
          media echo chambers were to be analysed, we would end up with two on
          each end of debates: conservative right vs liberal left, feminists vs
          anti-feminists, people who like pineapple on their pizza vs people who
          don’t.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>So what can be a solution to this?</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          The root cause of the problem is sourcing your news from social media,
          where more often than not the statements are tinged with some form of
          bias when presenting. Read more from news papers and legitimate
          sources, instead of the pages who self-proclaim their journalism while
          pumping inaccurate facts and misinformation to serve their purpose.
          Read beyond newspapers to get an understanding of the deeper
          background of problems before you channel your range into Instagram
          stories. And remember that raging on social media hardly counts as
          justice and speaking up requires the trodding of your thoughts from
          social media IRL and that is equally, if not more important.

    title: "Can education kill terrorism?",
    description: (
      <div class="container" style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
        <p>
          You must have heard this peaceful and woke statement multiple times,
          education is the right way to destroy terrorism. It actually sounds
          too good, too good to be true. Well, when you think about the
          terrorists who kill innocent people, shooting them point blank or
          commiting a suicide bombing, yes you may think that if these people
          were educated enough they would have known what is the right thing to
          do. These people get influenced by radicalism and do such horrifying
          things.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>
            So here’s a question, who is the real threat? The influenced or the
            influencer?
          </strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          The people who are recruiting the uneducated are themselves educated.
          You would be surprised to know that most of the terrorists working in
          terrorist organisations like ISIS, are engineers. That’s because ISIS
          search for people who are well educated. Most of them are graduated,
          have done their masters or are atleast school pass outs.
          <br />
          <br />
          <img
            src="https://officialasmevit.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/whatsapp-image-2020-09-07-at-2.52.45-pm-1.jpeg"
            alt=""
            style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto" }}
          />
          <br />
          <br />
          Now you must be thinking that maybe they need engineers to make bombs
          and do mechanical and chemical stuff or computer engineers to get the
          money transfered safely or hacking into severs. That is also not the
          case. That is only a partial reason. They believe that an educated
          person has a better thinking ability during chaos, that they can make
          rational decisions when times are tough. Now wasn’t this the whole
          point of getting people educated? To help them think rationally before
          joining any such organisation?
          <br />
          <br />
          Which name pops up in your mind when I say the word ‘terrorist’? For
          most of us, it is Bin Laden. That guy was more educated then all of
          the people combined in your colony. We cannot bring reform with
          education. That knowledge is only empowering them to do those things
          in more professional ways.
          <br />
          <br />
          On an individual level, we cannot change the ideology of an entire
          terrorist organisation. Individual ideological transformation is the
          key. Helping people to notice what are the consequences of this
          rebelliousness, showing them this is not for any good cause. If people
          start being self aware about what is good for them, they may not make
          these kind of choices. We have to help them acknowledge the fact that
          all this is not going to result in a positive way, for a society.
          Children are being taught these values since thier childhood so it’s
          the only thing they believe in. These kids need proper guidance to
          build their future away from all these terrifying things. It will take
          decades with this method but it will work. There is no simple and
          quick solution for this global issue.

          The wait for Formula 1 2020 season to begin may have been frustrating,
          but the championship at last got off. But, as the world continues to
          battle the Co-ViD pandemic, Formula 1 fans have waited to see when and
          how the cars will finally return to the track. As, since the sun set
          on pre-season testing at the Circuit de Catalunya, on February,
          Formula 1’s rule-makers had postponed or cancelled the first few races
          of the season.
          <br />
          <br />
          Finally, a rescue package with eight European races squeezed into 10
          weeks, culminating with the Italian GP on Sept. 6, was scrambled
          together. Formula 1 still hopes to rearrange some of the postponed
          races in order to finish the season with 15 to 18 of the scheduled 22,
          with strict health and safety measures having been put into place.
          When asked, FIA president Jean Todt described the current situation as
          one of “opportunity”, as the reduced $145million Formula 1 cost cap
          will prevent teams from dropping off the grid once the post-pandemic
          economic landscape becomes clear, and glad that changes are being made
          to F1 that would likely have never been agreed upon in the past. There
          will also be two consecutive races at the British GP. If the season
          continues beyond Europe, it will end with races in Bahrain and Abu
          Dhabi in December. But, that plan will heavily depend on air travel
          and quarantine restrictions easing, countries opening their borders
          and other logistical factors. Formula 1 could see more European races,
          to achieve the target of 15 to 18 races this season. That would still
          be a world of improvement for race drivers stuck to virtual racing.
          <br />
          <br />
          Four months after the opening race was called off at the last minute,
          the Formula One season finally gets underway, on another continent and
          in a different-looking world. But, the sport has gone to considerable
          lengths to ensure it poses as little risk as possible of coronavirus
          infection. The opening eight races will be held behind closed doors
          and the paddock will operate as an enclosed biosphere. Team personnel
          will be tested for the virus every few days and practise social
          distancing. Under new rules to protect them from the CoViD-19
          pandemic, Formula 1 drivers can forget about podium celebrations this
          season and have to be content with the cool-down laps. There will be
          no standing together for the national anthem or trophies handed over
          directly by local dignitary and the pre-race drivers’ parade is
          scrapped. But the fans won’t be there anyway. Yah! No more, Lewis
          Hamilton crowd-surfing at Silverstone; giant Ferrari flags at Monza;
          fans crammed into every possible gap in Monaco; packed F1 fan
          festivals in central London? Leave alone Formula 1, for now, forget in
          any event. Hopefully these fan bans will only prove temporary and more
          so that next year brings with it a return to largely open gates, even
          if these are less ‘ajar’ than in the past. Social distancing protocols
          – if not regulations – are, though, likely to mean that packed
          grandstands and podium ceremonies are over for the foreseeable future.
          <br />
          <br />
          Even after all this, the triple header proved worth the wait, for the
          drama and the thriller film it was. Giving us the hope that this
          season is going to be another edge-to-edge corner turn.With, the
          35-year-old British driver, Lewis Hamilton, chasing his seventh
          Formula 1 title to equal Michael Schumacher’s record, and only needs
          to win five more races to beat Schumi’s mark of 91. And, the suspense
          to what might happen to the German veteran, at the end of the year
          after failing to agree on a new contract. Also in having an
          inconsistent list of top five, with many new a fast racers coming in.
          Now, The CoViD-19 has change F1, for better in some aspects and worse
          in others. Will the essence of the sport, namely for the fastest
          driver/car combination over a set distance at a particular avenue on a
          specified day, change? Hardly, if at all. Will global consumption of
          that spectacle change? Yes, largely for the better for the TV audience
          – which outranks live attendances by 500:2 over a season – will
          benefit greatly.
          <br />
          <br />
          Keeping that all aside, it is a season that should have marked a happy
          occasion for F1, 2020 being its 70th anniversary. A time to recall its
          origins when Italy’s Giuseppe ‘Nino’ Farina went from pole to flag at
          Silverstone in the first ever race on 13 May 1950, in the presence of
          Britain’s king and queen, and young princesses Elizabeth and Margaret.
          Silverstone remains very firmly on the calendar — hosting two races
          this year — and most of the teams are based in its orbit. And while
          having had 1018 world championship Grand Prix, we’ve seen 108
          different drivers and 35 different teams win races, and 15 teams and
          33 drivers win world titles. It’s also possible that a new name could
          be added to the list this year. Yah, some tracks have come and gone,
          and the calendar has expanded around the globe. But, F1 remains about
          talent, guts and innovation. It’s like the sporting arm of NASA:
          State-of-the-art boundary-pushing machines that make legends out of
          brave and clever humans, and for the rest of us mortals there’s vivid
          footage and staggering data that brings reality to what seems
          otherworldly.
          <br />
          <br />
          Everywhere, there are new norms. How long will this carry on? We don’t
          know, but this will be the new norm for the rest of the year for sure.
          Despite this uncertainty, one thing is absolutely certain: Human
          behaviour as we knew it has changed totally, at least for the
          foreseeable future. Based on prevailing wisdom such changes will
          affect every aspect of life, and, by extension, motorsports generally
          and Formula 1, more specifically. But as humans have survived greater
          crises and evolved into improved beings as a result. The same can be
          expected from F1, the septuagenarian, who has also evolved through few
          pandemics and two world wars, and when asked fearlessly replies, “I
          want to fight my fight. I was to drive my race. The rest I am prepared
          to face.” Everything will be different, but hopefully better!”

          What does black lives matter movement in USA tell us about the western
          world and what message can India take from it?
          <br />
          <br />
          Recently, America was gripped by one of the most serious protests
          against racism and police brutalilty across it’s various states. The
          western world has always appeared to be modern and progressive and is
          always looked up to, but is it a reality?? Or is the west just a shiny
          house of glass that looks beautiful in a pretentious manner but is
          actually fragile; because these protests have suddenly woken us up to
          a bitter truth, shattered our notions and made us question what we as
          a civilization are looking up to. 155 years have passed since the end
          of the American civil war and a 158 years have passed since president
          Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, yet the United
          States in 2020 is battling the sociopathic ideology of racism. Surely,
          the states have come a long way since 1855, but the people of a
          particular race are still finding problems in adjusting and mixing up
          in the American society. As we already know,this is not the first time
          a movement to end racial discrimination has taken place in USA. The
          American Civil Rights Movement of the 1940s was the most important
          non-violent resistance and civil disobedience against racial
          inequality led by Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks and Malcom X. The
          movement ended with United States signing the historic Civil Rights
          Act of 1968 abolishing discrimination of all kinds on the basis of
          race, sex, religion, ethnicity and granted voting rights to all. On
          the Other hand, India already abolished discrimination in a similar
          manner in Article 14 and 15 of the Indian Constitution 18 years before
          that back in 1950. This makes us think whether this society is
          actually modern and also leads us to ponder if their regressive nature
          is only limited to race. The answer is no to both.

          <br />
          The other problem they as a society have to deal with is sexism. Yes,
          gender inequality. A country, a civilization that is worshipped in
          India for it’s liberal socio-cultural approach especially towards the
          female gender is actually gripped by sexism that is far worse than
          India or as the fact of the matter, worse than any country in the
          world. The Indian youth is quick to notice that Women are allowed to
          wear whatever they want there, and moral policing is still a problem
          here, but their rudimentary mind fails to see that America and Europe
          combined have one of the highest numbers when it comes to crimes
          against women, there is an approximately 20 % difference between the
          wages of a man and a woman and the difference jumps to 40% when the
          woman is black. Women are objectified openly, picked out for their
          bodies, lifestyle and careers. Workplaces are still a nightmare there,
          opportunities for women are as limited as in any other ‘backward’
          country. The most striking fact is that women over there had to fight
          to get voting rights and in India, we didn’t even need to think about
          it and made universal suffrage mandatory since the beginning. There’s
          no doubt that many of these problems do exist in India as well, but
          there is something that we possess that nobody else does: our culture.
          The culture that has been the origin of everything in this world, a
          culture that if followed, makes a human always travel the right path,
          a culture whose depth is unmatchable and whose ideas are the most
          progressive and broad minded in the world; a culture which the whole
          world will slowly adapt to as the only way to lead a balanced life.
          That is what distinguishes us from them. We, as of now are people with
          strong foundation who are disconnected from our own ideas largely due
          to misinterpretations and foreign invasions, the sole reasons of our
          backwardness. Now, if we truly have to uplift our society, we have to
          stop looking at the west and go back to our own ideas, follow them and
          guide the rest of the world.

          You wake up everyday, cross your hall, walking past empty cups of
          latte, instead of seeing through the souls drinking them;
          <br />
          <br />
          you are driving to your workplace and back, with a taco bell in one
          hand, ignoring signals and the reds. You find your 9-5 exhausting,
          soaked into feigned disinterest;
          <br />
          <br />
          it’s the summer of 2020 and you are still lost in uncomprehended
          thoughts while you scroll down through your excel sheets. You are
          crashing deep into the heap of confusion as you daze in and out of the
          romantic sphere working out why they haven’t texted you today, while
          you include yourself in playing one of those pesky mind-games like you
          are hard to get;
          <br />
          <br />
          you are a part of the naturally shallow generation with a general
          presumption that 20-somethings just aren’t looking for love, swiping
          left through the screens and your feelings, both;
          <br />
          <br />
          you are constantly toeing the line, acting aloof, never truly
          expressing your feelings; you have this constant need for validation,
          while you give up on relationships that aren’t achieved by
          half-heartedness and ambiguity;
          <br />
          <br />
          you are plagued by inconsistency, fear, and hypersensitivity; striving
          for more than what the culture offers, hating the life you got but,
          𝘩𝘰𝘸 𝘥𝘰 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘩𝘢𝘵𝘦 𝘴𝘰𝘮𝘦𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘯𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳 𝘭𝘰𝘷𝘦𝘥?
          <br />
          <br />
          Instead of having a grip on your life, instead of trying to plan the
          very last aspect of your it, maybe give your life the chance to
          surprise you from time to time. life isn’t always sunny, but it can a
          lot more positive than we tend to appreciate it for.
          <br />
          <br />
          Do you love?
          <br />
          <br />
          And if you do, what would you do for your love?
          <br />
          <br />
          And is it that you have to ‘get’ to the life you want before you can
          start loving it? Or is it perhaps that you learn to love your life
          right now, and then life will happen ‘for’ you and not just ‘to’
          you?When you say you love a thing or a certain somebody, you accept
          the same in totality, beyond the flaws surrounding them. You are open
          to doubt, question your life and acknowledge the shortcomings and
          still love it beyond everything. The true meaning of loving and living
          through it, is the need to live in alignment with the purpose. This
          purpose could be anything-an artist waiting to be flown in a
          melancholic something, a sales expert wanting to discover a new path
          in business, or a workaholic seeking the level of happiness of that of
          a five year old sugar-high kid on a giant fairy wheel. Your purpose
          might demand you to create a story, fearless and imperfect, woven out
          out of uneven fragments; to interpret the ways of the universe falling
          into a loop.
          <br />
          <br />
          As individuals, a lot of impact, though, on the processes evaluating
          what we love and what we don’t, depends upon the perception, emotions,
          or imagination that we are subjected to. You might not love your
          journalism because your friend thinks its future isn’t steady enough.
          While some are capable of following objectivity in its truest sense,
          others might simply fail to. We are so glued to the concept of
          materialism that in the process, we don’t quite realise that the end
          purpose of everything that we do doesn’t always have to be about
          numbers. What is different about us as millenials compared to previous
          generations is not just a matter of a few years now, we in fact have a
          different concept about life, altogether. Our finances are festered,
          sectors have cratered, personal lives are messed up and our peace,
          endangered. We are breathing off uncertainty and repeatedly loathing
          on the lives we got.
          <br />
          <br />
          Unhappy. Exhausted and simply, done.
          <br />
          <br />
          Thanks to the reality of modern 24/7 communication- we are subjected
          to a world full of ruthless competition. With all the instagram reach
          and twitter reactions, we are constantly reminded of the fact that we
          are never doing enough. We fail to look through the years of
          unrewarded hardships and harsh work realities underlying the success
          of many media profiles. What we jump over to is the conclusion,
          directly connecting us to the ground of failure. While devices and
          laptops make it psychologically exhausting for us to plan our lives
          strategically, sometimes they do work essentially as a reality check.
          Spending time on oneself to contemplate these questions about life, is
          crucially an investment in one’s own well-being.

          Humans are one of the most curious creatures who will go beyond
          lengths to conquer the world and expand their horizons. We have this
          nature instilled within us, right from era of Homo Sapiens to Vikings.
          To learn more about universe and its celestial bodies we sent
          spacecraft, probes, orbiters, humans and even animals to various space
          missions. As time progressed, we gradually discovered that sending
          mobile robots aka Rovers is more practical than sending liable
          spacepersons on these highly prime and costly missions. Rovers are
          Robotic devices to explore extra-terrestrial areas which may be semi
          or fully automated and equipped with camera, antennas, Lasers, robotic
          arms, spectrometer etc. These instruments help in collection of
          samples such as dust, soil, rocks, and even liquids which are
          essential in space exploration. With other countries like China, UAE
          on their way to launch future missions to space, the use of rovers
          will only increase to test and experiment the surface of these
          celestial bodies. From Lunokhod rover to moon by USSR in 70s, to
          Perseverance to Mars by NASA, there are great examples of how humans
          are always able to find their way to progress and learn from their
          previous to march ahead towards the unknown territory.
          <br />
          <br />
          Here are compact details of their instruments and current status of
          rovers sent to Moon and Mars: –
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Lunar Rovers</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          These missions were early attempts of various nations to learn about
          the lunar surface and to win the Space Race which were predominant in
          era of (1960-1980). These rovers were examples of how with limited
          technology and resources, humans still prevailed and achieved these
          successes. Here are some rovers which were sent to our own satellite
          Moon

              <strong>Lunokhod-1:</strong> boarded on USSR’s Luna 17 spacecraft,
              it was one of the first successful rovers to land on any celestial
              body. It was launched on November 10, 1970 and landed on 17th of
              same month. It was equipped with antennas, laser devices, x-ray
              spectrometer and telescope, cosmic ray detector. It has other
              devices too to test soil samples of lunar body. It was powered by
              batteries which were charged by solar cell which were recharged
              during day. Travelling a distance of 10.5 km, it remained
              operational for next 11 months till October 4 1971, where it
              returned more than 20,000 TV images and 206 high-resolution
              panoramas. In addition, it performed 25 lunar soil analyses.

              <strong>Sojourner:</strong> was the first wheeled vehicle to rove
              another planet by NASA. The First Mars Pathfinder mission was
              launched on December 6, 1996 that landed on July 4, 1997. It was
              designed for 8 sols but its mission extended up to 83 sols.
              Sojourner has solar panels and a non-rechargeable lithium-thionyl
              chloride battery of 150-watt hours. It had a 64Kb Ram CPU. It
              communicated with radio modem to send data to the base stations.
              The Alpha Proton X-ray Spectrometer determined the elemental
              composition of Mars rocks and dust, except for hydrogen. It had
              three cameras, comprising of 484 pixels. The rover needed the base
              station to communicate with Earth, despite continuously
              functioning even after the time communications ended. It travelled
              a distance of just over 100 meters by the time its communication
              was lost. It’s one of the popular rovers and has also been
              featured in Star Trek and The Martian.

          One of the most important aspects of a space mission is the landing of
          the lander on the extra-terrestrial surface where most of these
          endeavors fail. I remember how last year Pragyan (part of ISRO
          Chandrayaan 2 mission) rover was lost and was deemed to be a failure
          for our scientists. But now, NASA’s Perseverance shows that humans are
          explorers no pandemic would be able to stop them from achieving the
          impossible. I have the highest admiration for these brilliant science
          warriors working since the last 6 years to make such missions,
          successful. The way NASA continually strives to work and explore new
          territories with new missions of Dragonfly to launch in 2026 to Titan,
          just fuels up the fire within many such budding scientists and
          astronauts who wish to change the world and make it a better place.

          Ending my article by Carl Sagan’s words, “every planetary civilization
          will be endangered by impacts from space, every surviving civilization
          is obliged to become spacefaring–not because of exploratory or
          romantic zeal, but for the most practical reason imaginable: staying
          alive… If our long-term survival is at stake, we have a basic
          responsibility to our species to venture to other worlds.” and very
          rightly so!

          Whenever we discuss about the possibility of a shared existence of
          particles in the same electromagnetic field of ours, we immediately
          find ourselves correlating it to the principles of quantum physics
          with a desperate need for a conclusion that might sound more certain
          that what we have been left with, since decades.
          <br />
          <br />
          The assumptions made about the coexistence of a different set of
          particles or atomic units, mess up with the already prevalent
          information and facts that have stayed traditional in reference to
          universe and its theories. However, there have been superficial events
          occured, that do demand a change in how we perceive science. The time
          capsule idea encountered by MIT administrators suspect it to be a
          strong evidence to the potential power of these ambiguities. In
          accordance to the Einstein’s general theory of relativity which
          clearly states that we perceive as the force of gravity arises from
          the curvature of space and time that govern our daily lives in order,
          this very structure of space-time unifies with the very concept of
          quantum theory, as well. While one event might take place just at the
          same time as another, each of them might be the reason behind the
          other. This validates that the observers of each of these might travel
          at different velocities, explaining a part of the Einstein’s theory.
          These space-time relations could be termed as quantum relationalism.
          While they do, the ways and directions to calculate the distances may
          cross may vary. As these particles are closely related, they share one
          quantum space, from where they are allowed to traverse different
          paths. Inspite of measuring their locations from universally opposite
          points, the measurements match and quite surprisingly so.
          <br />
          <br />
          One of the perennial paradoxes of quantum theories could be traced
          back to its relation with the perception of these space-time
          realtioons. Quantum mechanics can be used to define the smallest bits
          of the universal objects. While quantum physicists is capable of
          accomplishing what ordinary individuals can’t, predicting the link
          between quantum theory and the objective reality has been equally
          challenging for them too. The notion has always sounded skeptical and
          puzzling at the same time. Our view of the world is generally how we
          perceive it as a whole. The objective side of it is probably something
          that exists independent of the subject’s perception of it. When we
          perceive objects or people beyond what they actually possess, there
          lies a ground for questions. Similarly, when we undermine the
          assumption of science about the basic existence of an objective world,
          discrepancies follow. Two different parties are entitled to their own
          sets of alternative facts and very rightly so. The reality perceived
          by one cannot be reconciled with the reality perceived by another. The
          answers to all such complexities of the world, encompassing quantum
          fields and black holes. While some researches might argue that
          objectivity is an illusion, some believe that neither quantum nor
          classical physics provides any principled means for saying what counts
          as an object.
          <br />
          <br />
          Science and its reliable notions of observation, measurement and
          repeatability have times and again been counter intuitive to the
          foundations of the quantum realm. Such scenarios have long remained an
          interesting thought experiment and how they reflect reality. According
          to an experiment conducted to overrule the theory of superposition,
          under certain assumptions, measurements in quantum mechanics are
          subjective to observers. It was argued that applying quantum mechanics
          to an observer that is themselves being observed could be a distinct
          reversal to the objectivity theory. According to the theory, particles
          can co-exist in several places or states at once — this is called a
          superposition. But oddly, this is only the case when they aren’t
          observed. The second we observe a quantum system, it picks a specific
          location or state — breaking the superposition. To evaluate the same,
          composing a framework, the entire experiment is said to be devised
          into a method inclusive of two different boxes- the observers measure
          on a shared state. The results are then summed up to evaluate an
          inequality failing of which, observers could have alternative facts.
          There isn’t any access to this fact and to prove it, both the
          particles have to be in a superposition of all possible outcomes of
          the experiment. This however, presented a problem because the reality
          perceived by one didn’t match with the one seen by another. This
          experiment therefore shows that, we do need to rethink our notion of
          objectivity. Scientists viewed this as a new development as
          strengthening observations to accommodate more than one outcome to
          occur.
          <br />
          <br />
          A defender of the prospects for objective knowledge however, might
          root for clear and distinct ideas distinguishing the reliable
          perceptions of objective truth from subjective experiences. Despite
          plausible ways of arguing that subjective reality is what the world is
          heading towards, there is a general explanation that lines within. We
          are usually much more confident about our instincts and knowledge
          about a certain topic, rather than believing someone else’s thought
          put worth. This agreement is based mostly on one’s subjective
          impressions of perceiving subjects agreeing with one’s own judgments
          only. When we value our judgements over something that is consistently
          valued by others, on a universal basis, it’s likely to be wrong or to
          have incurred some error. One can also argue that agreement indicates
          probable truth, as it is unlikely that you and I would both be wrong
          in our judgment regarding an object and both be wrong in exactly the
          same way. The differences are usually marked in the philosophy of
          mind. Observing something from the subjective point of view is
          something that we humans are used to, and is central to the basic
          psychology of our mind. Whether or not this subjective conscious
          experience influences quantum mechanics might be needed to fully
          understand how the human brain works. Like the quantum objects can
          apparently be in two places or states at once, it’s highly predictable
          that the mind can hold onto two conjectural ideas at the same time.
          Because of this theory of entanglement, two such ideas might thus in
          turn become entangled: a kind of quantum superposition of thoughts.
          Highly speculative and disturbing as it sounds, the idea of quantum
          consciousness has had a long history.
